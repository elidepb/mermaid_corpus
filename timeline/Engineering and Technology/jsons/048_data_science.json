            "description": "Data Science emerged from statistics, computer science, and domain-specific analysis convergence. Early statistical methods developed in the 1600s-1800s provided mathematical foundations. The term data science appeared in the 1960s describing work with data. Relational databases (1970s) enabled structured data storage and SQL querying. Statistical software like SAS (1976) and SPSS facilitated analysis. The data warehousing concept emerged in the 1980s for business intelligence. The World Wide Web (1990s) generated massive data volumes requiring new approaches. The term data mining gained popularity in the 1990s for pattern discovery. Big Data became prominent around 2005 with web-scale data challenges. Hadoop (2006) provided distributed processing framework. The Data Scientist role gained recognition through DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher (2008) at LinkedIn and Facebook. Machine learning libraries like scikit-learn (2007) democratized advanced analytics. Cloud computing platforms (2010s) provided scalable infrastructure. Deep learning breakthroughs (2012+) expanded analytical capabilities. Today's data science integrates AutoML, MLOps, real-time analytics, and responsible AI practices.",
