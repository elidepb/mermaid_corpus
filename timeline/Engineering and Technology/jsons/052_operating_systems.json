            "description": "The history of operating systems began in the 1950s with batch processing systems that automated job sequences. The 1960s introduced multiprogramming and time-sharing (CTSS, Multics), enabling multiple users simultaneously. 1969 marked Unix's creation at Bell Labs. The 1970s saw microcomputer OSs emerge. 1981 brought MS-DOS for IBM PCs. 1984 introduced Macintosh with GUI. 1985 launched Windows 1.0. 1991 saw Linux's open-source debut. 2001 introduced macOS X with Unix foundations. 2007 revolutionized mobile OS with iOS, followed by 2008's Android. Modern developments continue with cloud-integrated and AI-enhanced operating systems.",
