            "description": "Nanotechnology's conceptual foundations began with Richard Feynman's 1959 lecture There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, envisioning atomic-scale manipulation. The 1970s-80s brought enabling technologies: scanning tunneling microscope invention (STM, 1981, Binnig and Rohrer) and atomic force microscope (AFM, 1986). 1985 saw fullerene (C60) discovery (Kroto, Curl, Smalley). The term nanotechnology was popularized in the 1980s by K. Eric Drexler. The 1990s witnessed carbon nanotube discovery (Iijima, 1991), quantum dot development, and first commercial nanotech products. 1999 launched President Clinton's National Nanotechnology Initiative in the U.S. The 2000s brought graphene isolation (Geim and Novoselov, 2004, Nobel Prize 2010), nanomedicine advances, and nanoelectronics commercialization. The 2010s saw CRISPR combined with nanoparticles, quantum dot displays, DNA origami techniques, and commercial nanocoatings proliferation. The 2020s continue with mRNA vaccines using lipid nanoparticles, quantum computing advances, 2D materials beyond graphene, nanoplastics concerns driving research, sustainable nanotechnology, and AI-designed nanomaterials becoming reality.",
