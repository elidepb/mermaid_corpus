            "description": "Transportation engineering evolved from ancient road systems (Roman roads, Silk Road) demonstrating early engineering principles. The 18th-19th centuries brought systematic road construction methods (Telford, McAdam) and railway development revolutionizing land transport. The early 1900s witnessed automobile proliferation necessitating paved roads and the first traffic signals (1914). The 1920s-30s introduced highway planning principles, early traffic engineering studies, and parkway development. The 1950s-60s marked the Interstate Highway System construction in the U.S. (initiated 1956), urban freeway development, and traffic engineering formalization. The 1970s brought transportation planning models, environmental impact considerations, and public transit investments. The 1980s-90s introduced intelligent transportation systems (ITS), traffic simulation software, and sustainable transportation concepts. The 2000s advanced with GPS navigation, traffic management centers, bus rapid transit systems, and complete streets design. The 2010s-2020s continue with autonomous vehicle testing, mobility as a service platforms, electric vehicle infrastructure deployment, micromobility integration (bike-sharing, e-scooters), connected and automated vehicles, and data-driven transportation planning becoming standard practice.",
