            "description": "Chemical engineering emerged in the late 1800s as industries required systematic approaches to chemical production. The profession formally began with George E. Davis's Handbook of Chemical Engineering (1901) and the first chemical engineering degree programs. The early 1900s saw the development of unit operations concept (Arthur D. Little, 1915), establishing systematic approaches to process design. The 1920s-30s brought petroleum refining advances, catalytic cracking, and polymer chemistry development. The 1940s-50s witnessed petrochemical industry expansion, synthetic materials production, and the introduction of process control systems. The 1960s-70s advanced with computer-aided process design, reaction engineering theory, and environmental regulations driving cleaner processes. The 1980s-90s introduced process simulation software (Aspen Plus), biotechnology applications, and green chemistry principles. The 2000s brought process intensification, nanotechnology integration, and pharmaceutical manufacturing innovations. The 2010s-2020s continue with sustainable chemistry, carbon capture technologies, biorefining, advanced materials synthesis, and AI-optimized process control becoming standard practice.",
