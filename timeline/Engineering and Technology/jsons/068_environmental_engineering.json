            "description": "Environmental engineering's foundations emerged in the 19th century with public health concerns driving sanitation improvements and the first water treatment plants (London, 1829). The early 1900s brought chlorination for water disinfection (1908) and sewage treatment plant development. The 1940s-50s witnessed industrial pollution concerns rising and early air quality regulations. The 1960s marked a pivotal decade with Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962) raising environmental awareness and major legislation beginning. The 1970s saw landmark environmental laws: Clean Air Act (1970), Clean Water Act (1972), Safe Drinking Water Act (1974), and EPA establishment (1970). The 1980s addressed hazardous waste with RCRA and Superfund (CERCLA) legislation, plus advanced treatment technologies development. The 1990s brought sustainability concepts, life cycle assessment methodologies, and green chemistry principles. The 2000s advanced with membrane technology improvements, advanced oxidation processes, and climate change considerations. The 2010s-2020s continue with circular economy principles, microplastics research, PFAS treatment technologies, green infrastructure, carbon capture systems, and nature-based solutions becoming mainstream approaches.",
