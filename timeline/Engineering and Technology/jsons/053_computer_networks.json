            "description": "Computer networking history began in the 1960s with ARPANET, the precursor to the internet, developed by the U.S. Department of Defense. 1969 saw the first ARPANET message sent. The 1970s introduced Ethernet technology and TCP/IP protocol development. 1983 marked ARPANET's transition to TCP/IP, creating the modern internet foundation. 1989 brought Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web invention. The 1990s saw explosive internet commercialization and browser development (Mosaic, Netscape). 1997 introduced Wi-Fi (802.11). The 2000s witnessed broadband expansion, social networks, and cloud computing emergence. 2010s advanced mobile networks (4G/LTE), IoT proliferation. The 2020s continue with 5G deployment, edge computing, and AI-driven network management.",
