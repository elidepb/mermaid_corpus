            "description": "Telecommunications engineering traces back to 1837 with Samuel Morse's telegraph, enabling long-distance electrical communication. 1876 brought Alexander Graham Bell's telephone invention, revolutionizing voice communication. The early 1900s saw radio communication development (Marconi) and vacuum tube amplifiers enabling long-distance telephony. The 1940s-50s introduced microwave transmission, transistor invention (1947), and early computer networks. 1962 launched Telstar, the first communication satellite. The 1960s-70s brought fiber optic communication development, ARPANET (internet precursor), and mobile phone concepts. 1983 introduced the TCP/IP protocol standard and cellular networks (1G analog). The 1990s witnessed the World Wide Web explosion, GSM digital cellular (2G), and fiber optic backbone deployment. The 2000s brought 3G mobile broadband, Wi-Fi proliferation, VoIP technologies, and 4G LTE (2009). The 2010s advanced with fiber-to-home deployment, 4G LTE-Advanced, cloud communications, and 5G development beginning. The 2020s continue with 5G commercial deployment, satellite internet constellations (Starlink), 6G research, quantum communication experiments, and network virtualization becoming mainstream.",
