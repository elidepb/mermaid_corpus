            "description": "Computer architecture history began in the 1940s with ENIAC, the first electronic general-purpose computer, and the 1945 Von Neumann architecture concept introducing stored-program design. The 1950s saw transistor-based computers replace vacuum tubes. 1964 introduced IBM System/360 with compatible family architecture. The 1970s brought microprocessors (Intel 4004 in 1971, 8086 in 1978 establishing x86). The 1980s witnessed RISC architecture development and personal computer proliferation. 1993 introduced Intel Pentium with superscalar architecture. The 2000s marked multi-core processor era and 64-bit computing mainstream adoption. The 2010s advanced with mobile ARM dominance, GPU computing, and AI accelerators. The 2020s continue with quantum computing breakthroughs and neuromorphic chip development.",
