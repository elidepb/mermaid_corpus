            "description": "Agricultural Engineering evolved from simple tools to sophisticated precision systems transforming food production and rural development. Early agriculture used manual tools and animal power for thousands of years. Jethro Tull's seed drill (1701) enabled systematic planting in rows. The mechanical reaper invented by Cyrus McCormick (1831) revolutionized grain harvesting. Steam-powered tractors emerged in the late 1800s providing mechanical power. The internal combustion engine tractor by John Froelich (1892) initiated modern farm mechanization. The combine harvester integrated cutting and threshing (early 1900s). The Ferguson System (1930s) improved tractor-implement integration through three-point hitch. Synthetic fertilizers and pesticides increased yields (1940s-1950s). Center pivot irrigation systems developed (1948) enabling large-scale irrigation. The Green Revolution (1960s-1970s) combined improved varieties with mechanization dramatically increasing productivity. GPS technology applied to agriculture (1990s) enabling precision farming. Variable rate technology allowed site-specific input application. Drones and satellite imagery provided crop monitoring capabilities (2000s-2010s). Autonomous tractors and robots emerged for various operations. Vertical farming and controlled environment agriculture expanded. Today's agricultural engineering integrates AI for crop prediction, gene editing for crop improvement, blockchain for traceability, and climate-smart agriculture adapting to climate change while reducing emissions.",
