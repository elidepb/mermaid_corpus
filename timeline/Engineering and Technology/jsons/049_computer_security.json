            "description": "Computer Security evolved from physical security to sophisticated cybersecurity addressing global digital threats. Early computer security focused on physical access controls in the 1960s-1970s. The first computer worm, Creeper (1971), demonstrated self-replicating code. Encryption standards emerged with DES (1977) providing data protection. The Morris Worm (1988) infected 10% of internet-connected computers, highlighting vulnerability. Antivirus software proliferated in the 1990s combating malware proliferation. Firewalls became standard network protection in the mid-1990s. The ILOVEYOU virus (2000) caused billions in damages demonstrating email-based threats. The Code Red worm (2001) exploited web server vulnerabilities. Phishing attacks became prevalent in the early 2000s. The Stuxnet worm (2010) demonstrated sophisticated state-sponsored cyber weapons. Major data breaches at Target (2013) and Equifax (2017) exposed millions of records. Ransomware epidemics like WannaCry (2017) disrupted global organizations. Zero Trust architecture gained prominence in the late 2010s. Today's computer security addresses cloud security, IoT vulnerabilities, AI-powered threats, and quantum computing implications.",
