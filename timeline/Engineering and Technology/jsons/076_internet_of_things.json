            "description": "Internet of Things evolved from early machine-to-machine communication to ubiquitous connectivity transforming industries and daily life. The concept of networked devices appeared in early automation systems (1970s-1980s). The first internet-connected appliance was a Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon (1982) reporting inventory. Kevin Ashton coined Internet of Things (1999) while working on RFID technology at Procter & Gamble. IPv6 standardization (1998) provided address space for billions of devices. RFID technology proliferated in supply chain management (early 2000s). Smartphone adoption (2007+) enabled IoT application control and monitoring. Arduino (2005) and Raspberry Pi (2012) democratized IoT prototyping and education. Nest thermostat (2011) popularized consumer smart home devices. Industrial IoT gained prominence around 2014 with Industry 4.0 initiatives. Amazon Echo (2014) brought voice-controlled IoT into homes. 5G networks began deployment (2019) enabling massive IoT connectivity. Matter smart home standard launched (2022) promoting interoperability. Today's IoT integrates AI at the edge, digital twins for simulation, blockchain for security, and addresses sustainability through energy optimization.",
