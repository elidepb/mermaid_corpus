            "description": "Computational Genomics evolved from early DNA sequencing to high-throughput analysis transforming biomedical research and healthcare. DNA structure discovered by Watson and Crick (1953) laid molecular biology foundations. Sanger sequencing method (1977) enabled first DNA sequences but remained low-throughput. The Human Genome Project launched (1990) aiming to sequence entire human genome. BLAST algorithm (1990) revolutionized sequence similarity searching. First bacterial genome sequenced (1995) demonstrating whole-genome capabilities. Human Genome Project completed draft (2001) after decade-long international collaboration. SNP databases and HapMap project (2002-2005) cataloged genetic variation. Next-generation sequencing commercialized (2005-2007) with Illumina and 454 platforms dramatically reducing costs. The 1000 Genomes Project (2008-2015) characterized human genetic diversity. ENCODE project (2012) mapped functional elements across the genome. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing (2012) enabled precise genetic manipulation. Single-cell sequencing emerged (2014+) revealing cellular heterogeneity. Cancer genomics initiatives like TCGA generated comprehensive tumor datasets. AlphaFold (2020) solved protein structure prediction using AI. Today's computational genomics integrates long-read sequencing, spatial omics, AI-driven discovery, and population-scale biobanks.",
