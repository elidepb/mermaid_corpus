            "description": "Biomedical engineering's foundations emerged in the early 1900s with Willem Einthoven's ECG invention (1903) and the development of early X-ray technology. The 1920s-30s brought the iron lung ventilator and early prosthetic developments. The 1950s marked the field's formal establishment with the first pacemaker (1958) and dialysis machines. The 1960s witnessed heart-lung machines enabling open-heart surgery and the first successful hip replacement (John Charnley). The 1970s introduced CT scanning (Hounsfield, 1971), biomedical engineering degree programs proliferation, and cochlear implants. The 1980s brought MRI technology to clinical use, artificial heart developments, and arthroscopic surgical techniques. The 1990s saw robotic surgery systems (da Vinci), tissue engineering advances, and the Human Genome Project. The 2000s advanced with drug-eluting stents, 3D medical imaging improvements, and stem cell research progress. The 2010s-2020s continue with CRISPR gene editing, 3D-printed organs and implants, AI-assisted diagnostics, wearable health monitors, brain-computer interfaces, and personalized medicine becoming clinical realities.",
