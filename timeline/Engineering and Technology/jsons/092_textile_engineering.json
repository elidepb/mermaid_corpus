            "description": "Textile Engineering evolved from craft-based production to automated high-tech manufacturing integrating materials science and digital technologies. Hand spinning and weaving dominated textile production for millennia across cultures. The spinning jenny invented by James Hargreaves (1764) enabled multi-spindle yarn production. Edmund Cartwright's power loom (1785) mechanized weaving during the Industrial Revolution. The cotton gin by Eli Whitney (1793) automated fiber separation accelerating raw material processing. Synthetic fibers emerged with rayon (1894) as first commercial manufactured fiber. Nylon invented by Wallace Carothers at DuPont (1935) revolutionized synthetic textiles. Polyester developed (1941) becoming the world's most produced fiber. Spandex introduced (1958) provided exceptional elasticity for stretch fabrics. Computer-aided design systems transformed textile design (1970s-1980s). High-performance fibers including Kevlar (1965) and carbon fiber enabled technical applications. Shuttle-less weaving technologies like air-jet and rapier looms increased production speeds (1980s-1990s). Digital textile printing emerged (2000s) enabling customization and reducing waste. Nanotechnology applications enhanced textile properties with nanocoatings and nanofibers (2000s-2010s). Smart textiles integrated sensors, LEDs, and conductive fibers. Today's textile engineering employs 3D knitting, bio-fabricated materials, graphene-enhanced textiles, and AI-driven design optimization while addressing sustainability through circular economy principles.",
