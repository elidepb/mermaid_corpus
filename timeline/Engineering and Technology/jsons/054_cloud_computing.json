            "description": "Cloud computing's evolution began in the 1960s with time-sharing concepts enabling multiple users to access mainframes. The 1990s saw telecommunications companies offering VPN services and early virtualization. 1999 introduced Salesforce.com as pioneering SaaS. 2002 brought AWS's early web services. 2006 marked AWS EC2 launch, establishing modern IaaS. 2008 saw Google App Engine (PaaS) and Microsoft Azure announcements. The 2010s witnessed explosive growth with mobile cloud services, hybrid cloud adoption, and container technologies (Docker 2013, Kubernetes 2014). 2014 introduced serverless computing (AWS Lambda). The 2020s continue with edge computing integration, AI/ML cloud services, multi-cloud strategies, and enhanced security frameworks becoming standard.",
