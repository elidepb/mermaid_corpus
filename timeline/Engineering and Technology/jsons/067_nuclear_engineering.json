            "description": "Nuclear engineering emerged from the discovery of radioactivity (1896) by Henri Becquerel and subsequent research by Marie and Pierre Curie. 1905 brought Einstein's E=mc² equation establishing mass-energy equivalence. 1932 witnessed neutron discovery (James Chadwick) and 1938 saw nuclear fission discovery (Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassmann). The Manhattan Project (1942-1945) developed the first nuclear weapons and created the first controlled nuclear chain reaction (Enrico Fermi, Chicago Pile-1, 1942). The 1950s marked peaceful nuclear energy development with the first nuclear power plant (Obninsk, USSR, 1954) and first commercial US reactor (Shippingport, 1957). The 1960s-70s witnessed rapid nuclear power expansion worldwide and development of various reactor designs. The 1979 Three Mile Island accident and 1986 Chernobyl disaster prompted enhanced safety regulations. The 1990s-2000s brought Generation III+ reactor designs with improved safety features. 2011's Fukushima accident further advanced safety standards. The 2010s-2020s continue with small modular reactor development, Generation IV concepts, fusion energy progress (ITER project), and advanced fuel cycles emphasizing sustainability and waste reduction.",
