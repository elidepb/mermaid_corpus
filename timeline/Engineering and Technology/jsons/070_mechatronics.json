            "description": "Mechatronics emerged as a concept in 1969 when Japanese engineer Tetsuro Mori coined the term at Yaskawa Electric Corporation, combining mecha (mechanics) and tronics (electronics). The 1970s saw early integration of mechanical systems with microprocessors and the development of computer numerical control (CNC) machines. The 1980s brought industrial robot proliferation, programmable logic controllers (PLCs) advancement, and servo motor technology improvements. 1983 introduced the Arduino precursor concepts with embedded systems becoming more accessible. The 1990s witnessed rapid mechatronics education program establishment worldwide, anti-lock braking systems (ABS) in automobiles, and precision motion control systems. The 2000s advanced with MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) technology, smart sensors, wireless communication integration, and Arduino launch (2005) democratizing embedded systems. The 2010s brought Industry 4.0 concepts, collaborative robots (cobots), IoT integration, and autonomous vehicle development. The 2020s continue with AI-enhanced mechatronic systems, digital twins, edge computing integration, soft robotics, human-robot collaboration, and sustainable mechatronic design becoming standard practice.",
