            "description": "Mechanical engineering's foundations trace to ancient civilizations with simple machines (levers, wheels, pulleys) and water/wind mills. The Renaissance (15th-16th centuries) brought Leonardo da Vinci's mechanical designs and scientific analysis. The Industrial Revolution (1760-1840) revolutionized the field with James Watt's steam engine (1776), mechanized manufacturing, and the establishment of mechanical engineering as a formal discipline. The late 1800s saw internal combustion engines and mass production techniques. The 1900s witnessed assembly line manufacturing (Ford 1913), jet engines (1930s), and computer-aided design emergence (1960s). The 1980s-90s introduced CNC machining automation and CAD/CAM integration. The 2000s advanced with 3D printing, nanotechnology, and smart materials. The 2010s-2020s continue with sustainable engineering, Industry 4.0 integration, and AI-assisted design becoming standard practice.",
