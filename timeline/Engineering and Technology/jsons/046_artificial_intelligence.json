            "description": "Artificial Intelligence evolved from philosophical speculation to transformative technology reshaping society. The concept of intelligent machines appeared in ancient mythology and early automation. Alan Turing proposed the Turing Test (1950) for machine intelligence. The Dartmouth Conference (1956) coined artificial intelligence and launched the field with optimistic predictions. Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and problem-solving in the 1950s-1960s. The first AI winter (1970s) followed unmet expectations and funding cuts. Expert systems revived AI in the 1980s with commercial success. The second AI winter occurred in late 1980s-early 1990s due to limitations. Machine learning resurgence began in the 1990s with statistical approaches. Deep learning breakthrough came with AlexNet (2012) winning ImageNet competition. AlphaGo defeated world champion (2016) demonstrating reinforcement learning power. Transformer architecture (2017) revolutionized natural language processing. GPT-3 (2020) and ChatGPT (2022) demonstrated large language model capabilities. Today's AI integrates foundation models, multimodal learning, and pursues artificial general intelligence while addressing alignment and safety challenges.",
