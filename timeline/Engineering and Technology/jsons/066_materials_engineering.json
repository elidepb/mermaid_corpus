            "description": "Materials engineering has ancient roots with the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age marking major material developments in human civilization. The Industrial Revolution (1700s-1800s) brought steel production advances (Bessemer process 1856) and understanding of material properties. The early 1900s introduced stainless steel (1913), aluminum alloys, and early polymer development (Bakelite 1907). The 1940s-50s witnessed titanium production, synthetic polymers proliferation (nylon, polyester), and semiconductor materials for electronics. The 1960s brought composite materials development for aerospace and the beginning of materials science as a distinct discipline. The 1970s introduced advanced ceramics, high-strength steels, and engineering polymers. The 1980s-90s saw nanomaterials emergence, shape memory alloys, and high-temperature superconductors discovery. The 2000s advanced with carbon nanotubes, graphene isolation (2004), and metamaterials development. The 2010s-2020s continue with 2D materials, self-healing materials, programmable materials, additive manufacturing materials, biomimetic materials, and sustainable material alternatives becoming research frontiers.",
