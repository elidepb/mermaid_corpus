            "description": "Accounting's historical development traces from ancient record-keeping to modern digital systems. Luca Pacioli documented double-entry bookkeeping in 1494, establishing the foundation for modern accounting. The Industrial Revolution in the 1800s created demand for cost accounting. The 1929 stock market crash led to standardized financial reporting and the SEC's creation in 1934. The Financial Accounting Standards Board formed in 1973 to develop GAAP. International Financial Reporting Standards emerged in 2001 for global harmonization. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 strengthened auditing requirements post-Enron. Today's accounting integrates blockchain, AI, and real-time reporting technologies.",
