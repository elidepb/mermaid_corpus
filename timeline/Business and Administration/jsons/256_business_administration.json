            "description": "The evolution of Business Administration spans from early 20th-century scientific management to today's digital transformation. Frederick Taylor introduced systematic work studies in 1911, followed by Fayol's management principles in 1916. The human relations movement emerged in the 1930s, recognizing worker psychology. Peter Drucker popularized management by objectives in the 1954. The 1980s brought total quality management, the 1990s saw business process reengineering, and the 2000s ushered in lean methodologies. Current trends focus on agile management and AI-driven decision-making.",
