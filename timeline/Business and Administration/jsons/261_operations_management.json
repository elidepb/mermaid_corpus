            "description": "Operations Management's development parallels industrial and technological advancement. Frederick Taylor's scientific management (1911) introduced time-motion studies and standardization. Henry Ford's assembly line (1913) revolutionized mass production. Statistical quality control emerged in the 1920s through Shewhart's work. Post-WWII, Toyota developed the Toyota Production System (1950s), pioneering lean manufacturing and just-in-time inventory. Material Requirements Planning (MRP) computerized inventory management in the 1960s. Total Quality Management gained prominence in the 1980s. The 1990s brought business process reengineering and Six Sigma methodologies. Enterprise Resource Planning systems integrated operations in the 2000s. Today's operations leverage IoT, AI, and automation for smart manufacturing and real-time optimization.",
