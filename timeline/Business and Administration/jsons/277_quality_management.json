            "description": "Quality Management evolved from inspection-based approaches to comprehensive organizational systems. Frederick Taylor's scientific management (1911) introduced systematic work standards. Walter Shewhart developed statistical process control charts in the 1920s at Bell Labs. World War II accelerated quality control adoption in manufacturing. W. Edwards Deming taught statistical quality control to Japanese industry post-WWII (1950s), transforming manufacturing excellence. Joseph Juran's Quality Control Handbook (1951) established quality planning frameworks. Total Quality Management emerged in the 1980s, emphasizing organization-wide commitment. ISO 9000 standards were introduced in 1987, creating global quality certification frameworks. Motorola developed Six Sigma in 1986 for defect reduction. Lean manufacturing principles spread globally from Toyota Production System in the 1990s. Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (1987) promoted excellence. Today's quality management integrates digital quality systems, AI-powered defect detection, and real-time analytics.",
