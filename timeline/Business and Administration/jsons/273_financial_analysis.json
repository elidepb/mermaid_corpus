            "description": "Financial Analysis developed alongside accounting standards and capital markets evolution. Luca Pacioli's double-entry bookkeeping (1494) provided the foundation for systematic financial record-keeping. The Securities Act (1933) and Securities Exchange Act (1934) mandated standardized financial reporting in the US following the market crash. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) formalized in the 1930s-1950s created consistency in financial statements. Benjamin Graham and David Dodd's Security Analysis (1934) established fundamental analysis frameworks. The Financial Accounting Standards Board formed in 1973 to develop US accounting standards. International Financial Reporting Standards emerged in 2001 for global harmonization. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) enhanced financial reporting accuracy and corporate governance post-Enron. Fair value accounting gained prominence in the 2000s. Today's financial analysis integrates big data analytics, AI-powered pattern recognition, and real-time reporting systems.",
