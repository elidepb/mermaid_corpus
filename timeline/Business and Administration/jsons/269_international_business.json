            "description": "International Business evolved alongside globalization waves and technological advancement. The Age of Exploration (1500s) established colonial trade networks. The Industrial Revolution (1800s) expanded manufacturing exports globally. Adam Smith's absolute advantage (1776) and David Ricardo's comparative advantage (1817) provided theoretical foundations. The Bretton Woods system (1944) established post-WWII international monetary order. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1947) reduced trade barriers progressively. Raymond Vernon's product life cycle theory (1966) explained international production patterns. The World Trade Organization replaced GATT in 1995, strengthening global trade governance. NAFTA (1994) and EU expansion promoted regional integration. China's WTO entry (2001) transformed global manufacturing. Today's international business navigates digital commerce, supply chain resilience, protectionism trends, and sustainability imperatives.",
