            "description": "Foreign Trade history spans from ancient commerce routes to modern digital trade systems. The Silk Road (200 BCE-1400s CE) connected East and West through overland trade. Mercantilism dominated 16th-18th centuries, emphasizing exports over imports and colonial extraction. The Corn Laws repeal (1846) in Britain marked a shift toward free trade principles. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (1930) raised US duties, worsening the Great Depression and demonstrating protectionism's dangers. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1947) initiated multilateral trade liberalization. Containerization (1956) revolutionized shipping efficiency and global trade volumes. The Uruguay Round (1994) created the WTO and expanded trade rules to services and intellectual property. China's WTO accession (2001) reshaped global trade patterns. Today's foreign trade integrates digital platforms, blockchain documentation, and sustainability-linked trade policies.",
