            "description": "Human Resource Management evolved from administrative personnel functions to strategic business partnership. The industrial era (1900s-1920s) focused on welfare programs and labor relations. Scientific management introduced systematic job analysis. The Hawthorne studies of the 1930s revealed the importance of human factors in productivity. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (1964) established equal employment opportunity. Strategic HRM emerged in the 1980s, linking people practices to business strategy. The 1990s brought competency-based management and talent war concepts. The 2000s introduced HR analytics and evidence-based practices. Today's HRM integrates AI recruitment, employee experience platforms, and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.",
