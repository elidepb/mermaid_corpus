            "description": "Corporate Finance evolved from basic capital management to sophisticated financial engineering. The Modigliani-Miller theorems of 1958 established foundational capital structure principles. The Capital Asset Pricing Model emerged in 1964, revolutionizing risk-return analysis. Black-Scholes option pricing in 1973 enabled derivatives valuation. The 1980s saw leveraged buyouts and junk bonds reshape corporate financing. The 1990s brought real options theory to investment decisions. The 2008 financial crisis highlighted systemic risk management importance. Today's corporate finance integrates fintech, ESG considerations, and algorithmic trading into traditional frameworks.",
