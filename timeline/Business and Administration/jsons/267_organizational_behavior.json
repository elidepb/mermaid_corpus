            "description": "Organizational Behavior emerged from diverse disciplines including psychology, sociology, and management science. The Hawthorne Studies (1924-1932) revealed that social factors influence productivity more than physical conditions. Douglas McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y (1960) challenged assumptions about worker motivation. Frederick Herzberg's two-factor theory (1959) distinguished between hygiene factors and motivators. The Ohio State and Michigan leadership studies (1940s-1950s) identified key leadership dimensions. Organizational culture research gained prominence in the 1980s through Edgar Schein's work. Emotional intelligence concepts emerged in the 1990s, emphasizing interpersonal skills. Positive organizational behavior developed in the 2000s, focusing on strengths and well-being. Today's OB integrates remote work dynamics, diversity and inclusion, psychological safety, and neuroscience insights.",
