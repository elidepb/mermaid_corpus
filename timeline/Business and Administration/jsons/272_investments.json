            "description": "Investment practice evolved from simple speculation to sophisticated scientific discipline. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange (1602) created the first modern securities market with the Dutch East India Company. Benjamin Graham's Security Analysis (1934) established fundamental analysis principles and value investing philosophy. Modern Portfolio Theory, developed by Harry Markowitz in 1952, revolutionized portfolio construction through mathematical optimization. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (1964) by Sharpe, Lintner, and Mossin quantified risk-return relationships. The Efficient Market Hypothesis emerged in the 1970s, debating market predictability. Index funds launched by Vanguard in 1976 democratized low-cost investing. Black Monday (1987) highlighted market volatility and behavioral factors. The dot-com bubble (2000) demonstrated speculation risks. Exchange-traded funds proliferated in the 2000s. Today's investing integrates algorithmic trading, ESG criteria, and robo-advisory platforms.",
