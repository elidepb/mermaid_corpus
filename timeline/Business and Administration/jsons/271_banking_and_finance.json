            "description": "Banking and Finance evolved from ancient money lending to complex global financial systems. The Medici Bank (1397) pioneered double-entry bookkeeping and international banking networks. The Bank of England (1694) established central banking concepts. The gold standard emerged in the 1800s, linking currencies to gold reserves. The Federal Reserve was created in 1913 to stabilize the US banking system. The Great Depression (1929-1933) led to deposit insurance and Glass-Steagall separation of commercial and investment banking. Bretton Woods (1944) created the post-war international monetary system. The abandonment of gold standard (1971) introduced fiat currencies. Financial deregulation in the 1980s-1990s expanded banking activities. The 2008 financial crisis prompted Basel III capital reforms and enhanced regulation. Today's banking integrates cryptocurrency, open banking APIs, and digital-only institutions.",
