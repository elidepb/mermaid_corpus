            "description": "Entrepreneurship's evolution reflects changing economic paradigms and innovation drivers. The Industrial Revolution (1760s-1840s) sparked manufacturing entrepreneurship. Joseph Schumpeter's theory of creative destruction (1942) formalized entrepreneurial economics. Silicon Valley emerged in the 1950s-1960s as a technology entrepreneurship hub. The personal computer revolution of the 1970s-1980s democratized technology ventures. The dot-com boom (1995-2000) created internet entrepreneurship, followed by the bust that taught valuation lessons. The lean startup methodology emerged in 2008, emphasizing rapid iteration and customer validation. The smartphone era (2010s) enabled mobile-first businesses and the gig economy. Today's entrepreneurship integrates AI, blockchain, sustainability focus, and global remote teams.",
