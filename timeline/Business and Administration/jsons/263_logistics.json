            "description": "Logistics has evolved from basic transportation to sophisticated global networks. Ancient trade routes like the Silk Road (200 BCE) established early logistics concepts. The railroad expansion in the 1800s revolutionized freight movement. Containerization, pioneered by Malcolm McLean in 1956, standardized cargo handling and enabled global trade. The US military developed formal logistics doctrine during WWII and Korea. Deregulation of trucking and airlines in the 1980s increased competition and efficiency. The internet boom of the 1990s created e-commerce logistics demands. Amazon's fulfillment network transformed warehouse automation in the 2000s. Uber Freight and digital freight brokers disrupted traditional models in the 2010s. Today's logistics integrates autonomous vehicles, drone delivery, and AI-powered route optimization.",
