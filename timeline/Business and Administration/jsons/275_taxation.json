            "description": "Taxation history spans from ancient tribute systems to modern comprehensive tax codes. Ancient civilizations including Egypt, Rome, and China collected taxes on land, trade, and production. The Magna Carta (1215) established the principle that taxation requires consent. Britain's income tax emerged temporarily in 1799 to fund Napoleonic Wars, becoming permanent in 1842. The United States adopted income tax temporarily during the Civil War (1861), then permanently via the 16th Amendment (1913). Value-added tax originated in France (1954) and spread globally as an efficient consumption tax. The Tax Reform Act (1986) simplified the US tax code and lowered rates. The OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (2013) addressed multinational tax avoidance. Digital taxation debates emerged in the 2010s addressing tech giants. Today's taxation integrates automated compliance systems, global minimum tax proposals, and environmental taxation.",
