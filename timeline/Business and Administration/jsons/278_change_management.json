            "description": "Change Management evolved from industrial engineering to behavioral science-based discipline. Early scientific management (1910s) focused on process changes without human factors consideration. Kurt Lewin's force field analysis and three-stage model (1947) introduced psychological foundations for organizational change. The human relations movement of the 1950s-1960s emphasized people aspects of transformation. Organization Development emerged as a field in the 1960s, applying behavioral science to planned change. John Kotter's research on leadership and change began in the 1980s, culminating in his eight-step model (1996). Business Process Reengineering in the 1990s drove radical transformation initiatives. Prosci's ADKAR model (1998) provided individual change framework. The digital transformation wave of the 2010s required new agile change approaches. Today's change management integrates employee experience design, neuroscience insights, and continuous adaptation methodologies for rapid, ongoing transformation.",
