            "description": "Leadership thinking evolved from authority-based models to complex adaptive frameworks. Thomas Carlyle's Great Man Theory (1840s) proposed leaders were born, not made. Trait theories dominated early 1900s research, identifying inherent characteristics. The Ohio State and Michigan studies (1940s-1950s) shifted focus to leader behaviors. Fiedler's Contingency Theory (1964) introduced situational factors. James MacGregor Burns developed transformational leadership concepts in 1978, distinguishing transactional from transformational approaches. Robert Greenleaf's servant leadership philosophy (1970s) emphasized follower development. Emotional intelligence gained prominence through Goleman's work in 1995. Authentic leadership emerged in the 2000s, emphasizing genuineness and self-awareness. Today's leadership integrates inclusive practices, adaptive capacity, psychological safety, and distributed leadership models.",
