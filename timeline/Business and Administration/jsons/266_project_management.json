            "description": "Project Management evolved from engineering and construction practices to a formalized discipline. The Gantt chart, developed by Henry Gantt in 1917, revolutionized project scheduling visualization. The Manhattan Project (1942-1946) demonstrated large-scale project coordination. The Critical Path Method (CPM) and Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) emerged in the late 1950s for complex project scheduling. The Project Management Institute was founded in 1969 to professionalize the field. The PMBOK Guide was first published in 1987, establishing standardized practices. Agile methodologies emerged in the 2001 with the Agile Manifesto, emphasizing iterative development. PRINCE2 gained prominence in the 2000s as a process-based approach. Today's project management integrates AI-powered tools, hybrid methodologies, and remote collaboration platforms.",
