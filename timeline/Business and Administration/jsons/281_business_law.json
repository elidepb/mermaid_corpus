            "description": "Business Law evolved from merchant customs to comprehensive regulatory frameworks. Roman law and medieval merchant courts (1000s-1500s) established early commercial legal principles. English common law developed contract and property doctrines through judicial precedent. The Industrial Revolution (1800s) necessitated corporate law development for limited liability companies. The Sherman Antitrust Act (1890) initiated US competition law to prevent monopolies. The Uniform Commercial Code, developed in the 1950s, standardized commercial transactions across US states. Securities regulation emerged after the 1929 crash with the Securities Act (1933) and Securities Exchange Act (1934). Employment law expanded significantly in the 1960s-1970s with Civil Rights Act, OSHA, and ERISA. Intellectual property protection strengthened with the Copyright Act (1976) and digital provisions. Sarbanes-Oxley (2002) enhanced corporate governance post-Enron. GDPR (2018) revolutionized data privacy regulation. Today's business law addresses cryptocurrency, AI liability, gig economy classification, and ESG disclosure requirements.",
