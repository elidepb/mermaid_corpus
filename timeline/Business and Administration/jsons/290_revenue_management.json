            "description": "Revenue Management evolved from airline yield management to widespread application across industries. Early airline pricing used simple discount structures and manual controls (1950s-1960s). American Airlines pioneered computerized yield management systems in the 1970s, optimizing seat inventory allocation. Deregulation of the airline industry (1978) intensified price competition, accelerating revenue management adoption. Robert Crandall's leadership at American Airlines in the 1980s refined dynamic pricing strategies, creating competitive advantage against low-cost carriers. Academic research formalized revenue management science in the 1980s-1990s through operations research and economic theory. The hotel industry adopted revenue management in the 1990s, adapting airline techniques for room inventory. The term revenue management replaced yield management in the 1990s, reflecting broader application. Internet booking engines (late 1990s-2000s) enabled real-time pricing and expanded distribution channels. Machine learning and AI integration began in the 2010s, enhancing forecasting accuracy. Today's revenue management incorporates personalization, mobile platforms, big data analytics, and cross-industry applications in retail, entertainment, and healthcare.",
