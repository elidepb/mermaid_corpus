            "description": "Digital Marketing evolved alongside internet and mobile technology adoption. The World Wide Web launch (1991) created the foundation for online marketing. Early banner ads appeared in 1994, marking the first commercial internet advertising. Google's launch (1998) and AdWords (2000) revolutionized search marketing and PPC advertising. Social media platforms emerged in the early 2000s, with Facebook (2004) transforming marketing strategies. YouTube's founding (2005) enabled video marketing at scale. The iPhone launch (2007) ushered in mobile-first marketing. Content marketing gained prominence around 2010 with emphasis on inbound strategies. Marketing automation platforms matured in the 2010s. Influencer marketing exploded with Instagram growth (2012-2015). Voice search and AI-powered personalization emerged in the late 2010s. Today's digital marketing integrates omnichannel strategies, privacy-first approaches, and AI-driven optimization.",
