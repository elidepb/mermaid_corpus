            "description": "Auditing evolved from basic account verification to sophisticated assurance services. Ancient civilizations employed auditors to verify tax collections and government accounts. The industrial revolution (1800s) created demand for independent verification of corporate accounts. The Companies Act of 1844 in Britain mandated external audits for corporations. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants formed in 1887 to professionalize the field. The Securities Acts (1933-1934) required independent audits for public companies following the market crash. Generally Accepted Auditing Standards formalized in 1947 established professional guidelines. The Treadway Commission (1985) led to COSO framework development for internal controls. The Enron scandal (2001) exposed audit failures, prompting Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) and PCAOB creation for enhanced oversight. Today's auditing integrates data analytics, continuous auditing technologies, and blockchain verification.",
