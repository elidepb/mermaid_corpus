            "description": "Financial Economics evolved from descriptive finance to rigorous mathematical discipline. Irving Fisher's The Theory of Interest (1930) established intertemporal choice foundations. Portfolio theory revolutionized investing when Harry Markowitz introduced mean-variance optimization (1952), earning a Nobel Prize. The Modigliani-Miller theorems (1958) proved capital structure irrelevance under perfect markets. The Capital Asset Pricing Model emerged simultaneously from Sharpe (1964), Lintner, and Mossin, quantifying systematic risk. The Efficient Market Hypothesis formalized by Fama (1970) sparked decades of debate about market predictability. Black-Scholes option pricing model (1973) transformed derivatives markets and earned Nobel recognition. Arbitrage Pricing Theory developed by Ross (1976) provided multifactor alternative to CAPM. Behavioral finance gained prominence in the 1980s-1990s through Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory. The 2008 financial crisis highlighted systemic risk and model limitations. Today's financial economics integrates machine learning, high-frequency data analysis, and climate finance considerations.",
