            "description": "Business Strategy evolved from military concepts to sophisticated management discipline. Early strategic thinking drew from Sun Tzu's Art of War (500 BCE) and military strategy. Alfred Chandler's Strategy and Structure (1962) established that structure follows strategy. Igor Ansoff's corporate strategy framework (1965) introduced growth matrices. The Boston Consulting Group developed the growth-share matrix in 1970. Michael Porter's competitive strategy framework (1980) revolutionized industry analysis with Five Forces and generic strategies. The resource-based view emerged in the 1990s, emphasizing internal capabilities. Blue Ocean Strategy (2005) proposed value innovation in uncontested markets. Strategic agility and platform business models dominated the 2010s. Today's strategy integrates digital transformation, sustainability, and ecosystem thinking.",
