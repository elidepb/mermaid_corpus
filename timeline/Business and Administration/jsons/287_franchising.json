            "description": "Franchising evolved from medieval guild systems to sophisticated global business model. Early franchise concepts appeared in medieval Europe with guilds licensing craftsmen and church franchising tax collection rights. Modern franchising began with Isaac Singer's sewing machine distribution system (1850s) using independent dealers. The automobile industry adopted franchising with car dealerships in the early 1900s. Soft drink bottlers like Coca-Cola (1899) pioneered product franchising. Howard Johnson's restaurant chain (1930s) established early hospitality franchising. Ray Kroc's McDonald's transformation (1955) perfected the business format franchise model combining product, service, and systems. The International Franchise Association formed in 1960 to promote industry interests. Federal Trade Commission implemented the Franchise Rule (1979) requiring disclosure documents protecting franchisees. Fast-food franchising exploded globally in the 1980s-1990s. Service franchises expanded in sectors like fitness, education, and home services. International franchising accelerated in the 2000s. Today's franchising integrates digital ordering systems, data analytics, virtual training, and social responsibility programs.",
