            "description": "Supply Chain Management evolved from fragmented logistics functions to integrated strategic systems. The term supply chain emerged in the 1980s as companies recognized the importance of coordinating multiple partners. Just-in-Time inventory practices spread from Toyota globally during this period. Enterprise Resource Planning systems in the 1990s enabled cross-functional integration. The bullwhip effect was formally analyzed by Lee et al. in 1997, revealing demand amplification problems. RFID technology and advanced tracking emerged in the 2000s. The 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami highlighted supply chain vulnerability, driving risk management focus. Industry 4.0 principles transformed operations in the 2010s. Today's supply chains leverage AI, machine learning, and digital twins for resilience and real-time optimization.",
