            "description": "Climatology's origins trace to ancient civilizations with empirical climate observations for agriculture and early climate classification attempts by Greeks (climate zones based on latitude). The 18th-19th centuries brought systematic meteorological observations, establishment of weather station networks, and early climate data compilation. 1817 saw Alexander von Humboldt's isothermal maps pioneering climate cartography. The late 1800s introduced the Köppen climate classification system (1884, refined 1900-1936) which remains widely used. The early 1900s witnessed Milankovitch theory (1920s) explaining ice age cycles through orbital variations and expansion of global observational networks. The 1950s-60s brought the International Geophysical Year (1957-58) enhancing global cooperation, early computer modeling of climate, and Keeling Curve documenting rising atmospheric CO2. The 1970s saw satellite meteorology revolutionizing climate observations, climate variability research advancing (ENSO understanding), and growing recognition of human influence on climate. The 1980s-90s marked climate change emergence as major scientific issue with IPCC establishment (1988), coupled ocean-atmosphere models development, and paleoclimate reconstruction advances (ice core records). The 2000s brought improved climate models, extreme event attribution studies, climate services development, and reanalysis datasets (ERA-Interim, ERA5). The 2010s-2020s continue with high-resolution climate projections, CMIP model intercomparisons, climate informatics and big data applications, rapid attribution of extreme events, climate tipping points research, and integration of indigenous and local knowledge in climate science becoming standard practice.",
