            "description": "Water resources management traces to ancient civilizations (3000 BCE onwards) with irrigation systems in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Indus Valley, along with Roman aqueducts demonstrating early water engineering. The Middle Ages saw irrigation expansion and water mills. The 19th century brought modern urban water supply systems, sewage infrastructure, and large dam construction beginning. The early 1900s witnessed major dam building era (Hoover Dam 1936), irrigation projects expansion, and hydropower development. The 1960s-70s saw large-scale water projects globally and growing recognition of environmental impacts. The 1977 UN Water Conference in Mar del Plata marked international cooperation on water issues. The 1980s-90s brought the Dublin Principles (1992) establishing IWRM framework, recognizing water as an economic good, and emphasizing participatory approaches. The 2000 Millennium Development Goals included water and sanitation targets. The 2000s advanced with water scarcity concerns increasing, virtual water and water footprint concepts emerging, and river basin management approaches spreading. The 2010s saw Sustainable Development Goal 6 (2015) focusing on water and sanitation for all, drought and flood events intensifying due to climate change, and groundwater depletion crises (California, India). The 2020s continue with water-energy-food nexus integration, nature-based solutions for water management, smart water technologies deployment, circular water economy concepts, climate adaptation in water planning, and transboundary water cooperation becoming increasingly critical amid growing water stress.",
