            "description": "Ecological restoration emerged in the early 1900s with Aldo Leopold's pioneering work on prairie restoration at the University of Wisconsin Arboretum (1934), establishing restoration ecology as a scientific pursuit. The 1930s-40s saw Civilian Conservation Corps projects in the U.S. addressing soil erosion and reforestation during the Depression era. The 1960s-70s brought growing environmental awareness with wetland restoration projects beginning, mine reclamation laws enacted (Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, 1977), and early river restoration initiatives. The 1980s marked formalization with the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) founding (1988), increasing recognition of restoration as a distinct discipline, and development of restoration ecology theory. The 1990s advanced with restoration ecology textbooks published, reference ecosystem concepts developed, large-scale ecosystem restoration projects initiated (Everglades restoration, Kissimmee River), and ecological engineering integration. The 2000s brought ecosystem services framework application to restoration, climate change considerations in planning, restoration genetics emergence, and global restoration initiatives (Great Green Wall, Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact). The 2010s saw the Bonn Challenge launched (2011) targeting 350 million hectares of degraded land, China's massive reforestation efforts, coral reef restoration scaling, and restoration technology advances (drones for seeding, 3D-printed coral structures). The 2020s continue with UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030), nature-based solutions prominence, climate-adaptive restoration, indigenous-led restoration, restoration for carbon credits, technological innovations, and recognition that restoration is critical for biodiversity and climate goals.",
