            "description": "Biological conservation emerged in the late 1800s with early preservation movements, establishment of Yellowstone as the first national park (1872), and wildlife protection societies forming. The early 1900s brought the conservation vs. preservation debate (Muir vs. Pinchot), National Park Service creation (1916), and early wildlife refuges. The 1960s marked modern conservation biology's beginning with Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962) raising environmental awareness and the Endangered Species Preservation Act (1966). The 1970s saw landmark legislation including the Endangered Species Act (1973), CITES treaty (1975), and conservation biology emerging as a distinct scientific discipline. The 1980s formalized conservation biology with the Society for Conservation Biology founding (1985), conservation biology term adoption, and debt-for-nature swaps. The 1990s brought the Convention on Biological Diversity (Rio, 1992), systematic conservation planning development, biodiversity hotspots concept (Myers), and ecosystem services framework emergence. The 2000s advanced with Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005), conservation genetics expansion, payment for ecosystem services (PES), and community-based conservation growth. The 2010s introduced Aichi Biodiversity Targets, IPBES establishment (2012), conservation technology advances (camera traps, drones, eDNA), and rewilding movements. The 2020s continue with post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, 30x30 conservation targets (protect 30% by 2030), climate-biodiversity nexus recognition, nature-based solutions mainstreaming, indigenous-led conservation, and technology integration (AI, genomics) transforming conservation practice.",
