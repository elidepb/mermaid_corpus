            "description": "Climate Change encompasses multiple drivers, impacts, and responses. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and cement production; methane (CH4) from livestock, rice paddies, landfills, and natural gas leaks; nitrous oxide (N2O) from agriculture and industrial processes; and fluorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF6) from refrigeration and industrial applications. Climate system components involve the atmosphere, oceans (absorbing heat and CO2), cryosphere (melting glaciers and ice sheets, declining sea ice, permafrost thaw), and biosphere interactions. Observed impacts span temperature increases (global average warming, heat waves, shifting climate zones), precipitation changes (altered rainfall patterns, droughts, floods), sea level rise (thermal expansion, ice melt threatening coastal areas), extreme weather (intensified hurricanes, wildfires, storms), ocean changes (acidification, warming, deoxygenation), and ecosystem effects (species migration, phenological changes, coral bleaching, biodiversity loss). Mitigation approaches include renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal), energy efficiency improvements, electrification of transport, carbon capture and storage (CCS), nature-based solutions (reforestation, afforestation, wetland restoration, soil carbon sequestration), and sustainable agriculture. Adaptation strategies feature climate-resilient infrastructure, early warning systems, water conservation, drought-resistant crops, coastal defenses (seawalls, managed retreat), and ecosystem-based adaptation. International frameworks include the UNFCCC, Paris Agreement (limiting warming to 1.5-2°C), IPCC assessments, and nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Emerging technologies involve direct air capture, green hydrogen, carbon utilization, and climate engineering proposals.",
