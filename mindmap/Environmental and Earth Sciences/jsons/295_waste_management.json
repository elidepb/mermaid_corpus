            "description": "Waste Management encompasses collection systems, treatment technologies, regulatory frameworks, and circular economy strategies handling diverse waste streams sustainably. Waste categories include municipal solid waste from households and businesses, industrial waste from manufacturing processes, hazardous waste requiring special handling, construction and demolition debris, electronic waste containing valuable and toxic materials, and organic waste for composting. Collection systems employ curbside pickup with single-stream or multi-stream sorting, drop-off centers for convenience, commercial collection for businesses, and specialized hazardous waste collection events. Treatment technologies feature mechanical recycling sorting and processing materials, biological treatment through aerobic composting and anaerobic digestion producing biogas, thermal treatment including incineration with energy recovery and gasification, chemical recycling breaking down polymers, and landfill gas capture for energy. Waste hierarchy prioritizes prevention avoiding waste generation, reduction minimizing quantities, reuse extending product life, recycling processing into new materials, energy recovery converting to power, and disposal as last resort. Circular economy principles promote designing for durability and recyclability, industrial symbiosis using waste as inputs, extended producer responsibility, sharing economy models, and regenerative systems. Challenges address contamination in recycling streams, plastic waste persistence, electronic waste toxicity, developing country infrastructure gaps, and behavior change requirements. Emerging technologies employ AI-powered sorting robots, chemical recycling innovations, waste-to-hydrogen conversion, blockchain for waste tracking, and smart bins optimizing collection routes.",
