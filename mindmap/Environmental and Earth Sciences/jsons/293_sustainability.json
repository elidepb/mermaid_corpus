            "description": "Sustainability encompasses environmental, economic, and social dimensions creating integrated frameworks for responsible development and resource management. Environmental sustainability addresses climate change mitigation through carbon reduction and adaptation strategies, biodiversity conservation protecting ecosystems and species, resource management using renewable materials sustainably, pollution prevention minimizing waste and emissions, and ecosystem restoration repairing degraded habitats. Economic sustainability promotes circular economy closing material loops, green economy investing in environmental sectors, sustainable finance directing capital responsibly, resource efficiency maximizing output per input, and innovation developing clean technologies. Social sustainability ensures social equity providing fair opportunities and reducing inequality, community development empowering local populations, labor rights protecting workers, education and health improving well-being, and cultural preservation maintaining heritage. Measurement frameworks utilize Life Cycle Assessment evaluating environmental impacts, carbon footprinting quantifying greenhouse gases, water footprinting measuring consumption, ecological footprinting comparing resource use to capacity, and triple bottom line accounting for people, planet, and profit. Global frameworks include UN Sustainable Development Goals with 17 integrated objectives, Paris Agreement targeting climate action, circular economy principles minimizing waste, and ESG criteria guiding investment decisions. Implementation strategies employ sustainable supply chains, green building standards, renewable energy transition, zero waste programs, and stakeholder engagement. Challenges address greenwashing preventing misleading claims, balancing tradeoffs among dimensions, scaling solutions globally, financing transitions, and behavior change.",
