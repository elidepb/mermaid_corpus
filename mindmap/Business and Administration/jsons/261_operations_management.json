            "description": "Operations Management comprises interconnected domains that optimize production and service delivery. Process management designs efficient workflows using methods like process mapping and bottleneck analysis. Quality management implements systems such as TQM, ISO standards, and statistical process control. Supply chain operations coordinate procurement, logistics, vendor management, and distribution networks. Capacity planning balances demand with available resources through forecasting and facility decisions. Lean manufacturing eliminates waste via just-in-time production and value stream mapping. Project management applies methodologies to execute initiatives on time and within budget. Operations analytics uses data to drive performance improvement and predictive maintenance.",
