            "description": "Taxation encompasses diverse tax types, principles, and strategies across jurisdictions. Tax types include income tax on wages and business profits, corporate tax on company earnings, value-added tax on consumption, property tax on real estate, capital gains tax on investment profits, estate and gift taxes on wealth transfers, and payroll taxes funding social programs. Tax principles apply horizontal equity treating similar taxpayers equally, vertical equity imposing higher burdens on greater ability to pay, efficiency minimizing economic distortions, simplicity in administration and compliance, and certainty providing clear rules. Tax planning strategies employ income shifting across periods or entities, deduction maximization through allowable expenses, entity selection optimizing tax treatment, retirement account contributions, and charitable giving. International taxation addresses transfer pricing, tax treaties, foreign tax credits, and controlled foreign corporation rules. Tax administration involves revenue collection, taxpayer services, audit selection, and dispute resolution.",
