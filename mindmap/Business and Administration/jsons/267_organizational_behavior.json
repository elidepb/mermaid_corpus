            "description": "Organizational Behavior encompasses theoretical frameworks and practical applications that explain workplace dynamics. Motivation theories include Maslow's hierarchy of needs, Herzberg's two-factor theory, expectancy theory, and goal-setting frameworks that drive employee engagement. Leadership approaches range from transformational and transactional to servant and authentic leadership styles. Organizational culture shapes values, beliefs, artifacts, and behavioral norms through socialization processes. Team effectiveness depends on composition, cohesion, roles, trust-building, and collaborative mechanisms. Change management employs Lewin's force field analysis, Kotter's eight-step process, and resistance reduction strategies. Communication patterns utilize formal and informal channels, active listening, and feedback systems. Decision-making processes apply rational, bounded rationality, and intuitive models. Work-life balance initiatives promote employee wellness, engagement, and retention.",
