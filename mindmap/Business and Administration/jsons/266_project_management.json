            "description": "Project Management encompasses specialized knowledge areas that collectively ensure project success. Scope management defines and controls project boundaries through requirements gathering and work breakdown structures. Time management develops schedules using critical path analysis, Gantt charts, and milestone tracking. Cost management estimates budgets, controls expenditures, and forecasts financial performance. Risk management identifies uncertainties, assesses impacts, develops mitigation strategies, and maintains risk registers. Resource management allocates human capital, equipment, and materials efficiently. Quality management establishes standards, conducts inspections, and implements continuous improvement. Stakeholder management identifies interests, manages expectations, and maintains engagement. Integration management coordinates all knowledge areas into cohesive project execution.",
