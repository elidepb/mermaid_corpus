Competitive analysis employs Porter's Five Forces, competitor profiling, market positioning, and industry structure assessment. Strategic planning develops corporate, business, and functional level strategies with scenario planning. Growth strategies include market penetration, product development, market development, and diversification through Ansoff's matrix. Competitive advantages are built through cost leadership, differentiation, innovation, and resource-based capabilities. Strategic alliances form through joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, partnerships, and ecosystem development. Digital transformation integrates technology disruption, platform strategies, and data-driven decision making. Blue ocean strategy creates uncontested market spaces through value innovation.",
