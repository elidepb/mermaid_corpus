            "description": "Banking and Finance encompasses diverse institutions, markets, and products that constitute the financial system. Banking services include retail banking with checking and savings accounts, commercial banking providing business loans and trade finance, and investment banking facilitating capital raising and M&A advisory. Financial markets comprise money markets for short-term instruments, capital markets trading stocks and bonds, foreign exchange markets, and derivatives markets. Investment instruments range from equities and fixed income to mutual funds, ETFs, and alternative investments. Financial regulation enforces Basel Accords for capital adequacy, Dodd-Frank consumer protections, and anti-money laundering frameworks. Fintech innovations deploy digital banking, blockchain technology, robo-advisors, and peer-to-peer lending platforms. Corporate finance manages capital structure, working capital, and valuation. Central banking conducts monetary policy, regulates banks, and maintains financial stability.",
