            "description": "Knowledge Management encompasses systems, practices, and technologies for organizational learning. Knowledge types distinguish explicit knowledge that is codified and documented from tacit knowledge embedded in experience, intuition, and context. Knowledge creation follows the SECI model of Socialization (tacit to tacit), Externalization (tacit to explicit), Combination (explicit to explicit), and Internalization (explicit to tacit). Knowledge repositories include document management systems, wikis and intranets, lessons learned databases, and expert directories. Communities of practice connect practitioners around shared interests for knowledge exchange, problem-solving, and best practice development. Knowledge transfer mechanisms employ mentoring programs, job shadowing, exit interviews, and succession planning. Organizational learning promotes single-loop learning for error correction and double-loop learning for questioning assumptions. Knowledge metrics measure knowledge sharing frequency, content utilization, expertise development, and innovation outcomes. Technology enablers deploy collaboration platforms, AI-powered search, chatbots, and knowledge graphs.",
