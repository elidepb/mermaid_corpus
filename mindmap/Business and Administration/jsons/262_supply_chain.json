Supplier relationship management builds strategic partnerships through collaboration, performance monitoring, and risk assessment. Network design optimizes facility locations, transportation modes, and distribution channels. Inventory optimization balances holding costs against service levels using safety stock calculations and ABC analysis. Supply chain analytics leverages big data for demand sensing, predictive modeling, and scenario planning. Risk management identifies vulnerabilities and develops contingency plans for disruptions. Sustainability initiatives reduce environmental impact through circular economy principles and ethical sourcing. Technology integration employs blockchain, IoT sensors, and AI for transparency and automation.",
