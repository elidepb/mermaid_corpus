            "description": "Change Management encompasses models, strategies, and practices for guiding organizational transformation. Change models include Lewin's three-stage model of unfreeze-change-refreeze, Kotter's eight-step process emphasizing urgency and coalitions, ADKAR framework focusing on individual transitions through Awareness-Desire-Knowledge-Ability-Reinforcement, and the McKinsey 7-S model aligning strategy, structure, systems, skills, staff, style, and shared values. Change leadership requires transformational vision, emotional intelligence, coalition building, and resilience modeling. Resistance sources stem from loss of control, uncertainty, disruption to routines, and past change failures. Communication strategies employ town halls, newsletters, champions networks, and feedback mechanisms. Training and development build competencies through workshops, coaching, job aids, and support systems. Culture transformation shifts mindsets, values, and behaviors through symbolic actions and reinforcement. Measurement tracks adoption rates, performance metrics, and employee sentiment throughout transition phases.",
