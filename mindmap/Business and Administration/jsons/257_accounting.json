            "description": "Accounting encompasses multiple specialized branches serving different organizational needs. Financial accounting produces external reports following standardized principles, while managerial accounting provides internal data for planning and control. Cost accounting tracks production expenses, tax accounting ensures regulatory compliance, and auditing verifies financial statement accuracy. Each branch applies core accounting principles—matching revenue with expenses, conservatism in estimates, consistency in methods, and materiality in reporting—to fulfill its specific purpose within the broader financial information system.",
