            "description": "Quality Management encompasses philosophies, tools, and systems for organizational excellence. Quality philosophies include Total Quality Management emphasizing organization-wide commitment, Deming's 14 Points for transformation, Juran's Quality Trilogy of planning-control-improvement, and Crosby's Zero Defects concept. Quality tools employ control charts for monitoring, Pareto analysis for prioritization, cause-and-effect diagrams for root cause analysis, flowcharts for process mapping, and check sheets for data collection. Six Sigma methodology reduces variation through DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control) framework and statistical rigor. ISO standards provide certification frameworks including ISO 9001 for quality management systems. Lean principles eliminate waste through value stream mapping, just-in-time production, and continuous flow. Quality costs include prevention costs, appraisal costs, internal failure costs, and external failure costs. Customer focus drives voice of customer analysis, satisfaction measurement, and requirements translation.",
