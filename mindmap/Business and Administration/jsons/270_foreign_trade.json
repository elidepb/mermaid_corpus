            "description": "Foreign Trade encompasses specialized knowledge areas essential for international commerce. Trade policy frameworks include protectionism versus free trade philosophies, quota systems, import restrictions, and export promotion schemes. Customs procedures involve harmonized system classification, certificate of origin documentation, valuation methods, and inspection protocols. Incoterms define delivery responsibilities through FOB, CIF, EXW, and DDP terms that allocate costs and risks between parties. Trade finance instruments utilize letters of credit, documentary collections, open account terms, and export credit insurance. Free trade zones offer tax incentives, duty exemptions, and streamlined customs in special economic areas. Trade remedies apply anti-dumping measures, countervailing duties, and safeguard actions to protect domestic industries. E-commerce trade navigates digital customs, cross-border data flows, and online marketplace regulations.",
