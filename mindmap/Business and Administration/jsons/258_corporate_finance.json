            "description": "Corporate Finance encompasses specialized domains that collectively manage organizational capital. Capital budgeting evaluates long-term investment projects using NPV and IRR analysis. Capital structure determines the optimal debt-to-equity mix to minimize cost of capital. Working capital management ensures sufficient liquidity for daily operations. Valuation techniques assess company worth for mergers and acquisitions. Risk management identifies and mitigates financial exposures through derivatives and hedging. Financial planning forecasts future needs and aligns resources with strategic objectives.",
