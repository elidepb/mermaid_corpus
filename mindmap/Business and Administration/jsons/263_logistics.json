            "description": "Logistics comprises specialized operational functions that ensure seamless product flow. Transportation management selects carriers, optimizes routes, consolidates shipments, and negotiates freight rates across multiple modes. Warehouse operations design facility layouts, implement picking strategies, manage cross-docking, and maintain inventory accuracy. Distribution planning establishes network configurations, determines shipment frequencies, and balances costs with service levels. Materials handling employs automation technologies, conveyors, robotics, and packaging systems. Third-party logistics providers offer outsourced expertise in specialized services. Technology systems include warehouse management software, transportation management platforms, GPS tracking, and automated sorting. Customs and compliance ensure regulatory adherence for international shipments.",
