            "description": "Chemical Engineering encompasses diverse technical specializations and industrial applications. Fundamental concepts include material balances, energy balances, thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, and transport phenomena. Unit operations span distillation, absorption, extraction, crystallization, filtration, drying, mixing, and heat exchange. Reactor types include batch reactors, continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTR), plug flow reactors (PFR), packed bed reactors, and fluidized bed reactors. Process equipment comprises heat exchangers, pumps, compressors, separators, columns, and vessels. Analysis tools include Aspen Plus, HYSYS, MATLAB, and ChemCAD for simulation and design. Industrial sectors cover petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, polymers, food processing, biotechnology, and environmental engineering. Safety considerations involve HAZOP analysis, risk assessment, pressure relief systems, and material compatibility. Emerging areas include green chemistry, process intensification, nanotechnology applications, and sustainable manufacturing practices.",
