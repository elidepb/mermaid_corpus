            "description": "Artificial Intelligence encompasses diverse approaches, applications, and considerations for creating intelligent computational systems. AI approaches include symbolic AI using logic and knowledge representation, connectionist AI employing neural networks, evolutionary computation applying genetic algorithms, probabilistic reasoning with Bayesian methods, and hybrid systems combining multiple paradigms. Application domains span computer vision for image recognition and object detection, natural language processing enabling text understanding and generation, robotics providing physical embodiment and manipulation, expert systems capturing domain knowledge, game playing achieving superhuman performance, and autonomous systems making independent decisions. Machine learning paradigms include supervised learning from labeled data, unsupervised learning discovering patterns, reinforcement learning through trial and error, semi-supervised combining labeled and unlabeled data, and transfer learning applying knowledge across domains. AI ethics addresses algorithmic bias and fairness, privacy protection, transparency and explainability, accountability for decisions, and safety in deployment. Cognitive capabilities include perception processing sensory input, reasoning drawing logical conclusions, learning improving from experience, planning generating action sequences, and natural language enabling communication.",
