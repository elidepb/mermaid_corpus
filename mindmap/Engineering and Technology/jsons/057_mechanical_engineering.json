            "description": "Mechanical Engineering encompasses diverse specializations and knowledge areas. Fundamental subjects include statics, dynamics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, and strength of materials. Design tools comprise CAD (SolidWorks, AutoCAD, CATIA), FEA (finite element analysis), CFD (computational fluid dynamics), and simulation software. Manufacturing methods span CNC machining, 3D printing (additive manufacturing), welding, forging, and injection molding. Key application areas include automotive engineering, aerospace, HVAC systems, power generation, robotics, and biomechanics. Materials used range from metals (steel, aluminum, titanium) to composites, polymers, and ceramics. Professional skills involve problem-solving, project management, technical drawing, and quality control.",
