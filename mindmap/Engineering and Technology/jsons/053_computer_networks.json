            "description": "Computer Networks comprise various layers and elements working together. The OSI Model structures networks into seven layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application). Network types span LAN, WAN, MAN, and PAN. Key hardware includes routers, switches, hubs, and modems. Protocols govern communication (TCP/IP suite, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS, DHCP). Topologies define structure (star, ring, mesh, bus, hybrid). Security measures include firewalls, VPNs, encryption, and authentication. Transmission media use copper cables, fiber optics, or wireless technologies, while services encompass email, file transfer, remote access, and cloud computing.",
