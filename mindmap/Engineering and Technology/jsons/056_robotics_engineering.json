            "description": "Robotics Engineering encompasses multiple interconnected domains. Key robot types include industrial robots (manufacturing arms, CNC systems), service robots (cleaning, delivery, healthcare assistants), mobile robots (autonomous vehicles, drones, AGVs), and humanoid robots. Essential components comprise actuators (motors, servos, hydraulics), sensors (vision, LIDAR, proximity, force/torque), controllers (PLCs, microcontrollers, embedded systems), and end-effectors (grippers, tools). Core technologies involve kinematics and dynamics, control theory (PID, adaptive control), computer vision, machine learning, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), and motion planning. Applications span manufacturing automation, medical surgery, space exploration, agriculture, search and rescue, and entertainment.",
