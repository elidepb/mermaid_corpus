            "description": "Electrical Engineering encompasses diverse specializations and technical areas. Power engineering includes generation (thermal, hydro, nuclear, renewable), transmission systems (high-voltage lines, substations), and distribution networks. Control systems involve feedback control, automation, PID controllers, SCADA systems, and industrial control. Electromagnetic theory covers Maxwell's equations, wave propagation, motors (AC/DC, induction, synchronous), generators, and transformers. Signal processing encompasses analog and digital signals, Fourier analysis, filters, amplifiers, and communication systems. Key tools include circuit simulation software (SPICE, MATLAB/Simulink), oscilloscopes, and multimeters. Applications span power plants, electrical grids, motors and drives, telecommunications, lighting systems, and renewable energy installations. Professional standards include safety regulations (NEC, IEC), power quality, and reliability engineering.",
