            "description": "Software Development encompasses methodologies, paradigms, and practices for creating robust applications. Development methodologies include Waterfall with sequential phases, Agile emphasizing iterative development and customer collaboration, Scrum using sprints and daily standups, Kanban visualizing workflow and limiting work-in-progress, and DevOps integrating development and operations. Programming paradigms employ object-oriented programming with encapsulation and inheritance, functional programming emphasizing immutability and pure functions, procedural programming using sequential instructions, declarative programming specifying what rather than how, and event-driven programming responding to user actions. Software architecture patterns utilize layered architecture separating concerns, microservices decomposing into independent services, model-view-controller separating presentation from logic, event-driven architecture using message queues, and serverless leveraging cloud functions. Development practices include version control with Git for collaboration, code review ensuring quality and knowledge sharing, continuous integration automating builds and tests, test-driven development writing tests before code, and pair programming for real-time collaboration. Quality attributes address performance optimizing speed and efficiency, scalability handling growth, maintainability enabling changes, security protecting from threats, and reliability ensuring consistent operation.",
