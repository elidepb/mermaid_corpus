            "description": "Civil Engineering encompasses diverse specializations and technical areas. Structural engineering covers steel structures, concrete design, timber construction, and load analysis. Transportation engineering includes highway design, traffic engineering, pavement design, and transit systems. Water resources involve hydraulics, hydrology, drainage systems, irrigation, and coastal engineering. Geotechnical engineering addresses soil investigation, foundation design (shallow and deep), retaining walls, and slope stability. Environmental engineering focuses on water treatment, wastewater systems, solid waste management, and air quality. Construction management encompasses project planning, scheduling (CPM, PERT), cost estimation, and quality control. Key tools include CAD software (AutoCAD Civil 3D), structural analysis programs (SAP2000, ETABS), and BIM (Building Information Modeling). Materials used span concrete, steel, asphalt, timber, and geosynthetics. Professional responsibilities include safety compliance, building codes, sustainability practices, and public welfare considerations.",
