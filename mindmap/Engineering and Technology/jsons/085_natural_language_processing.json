            "description": "Natural Language Processing encompasses techniques, models, tasks, and applications enabling computational language understanding and generation. Core techniques include tokenization segmenting text into units, lemmatization reducing words to base forms, stemming removing affixes, part-of-speech tagging labeling grammatical roles, named entity recognition identifying proper nouns, dependency parsing analyzing grammatical relationships, and sentiment analysis determining emotional tone. Language models feature n-gram models predicting word sequences, neural language models using RNNs and LSTMs, transformer architectures with self-attention mechanisms, BERT for bidirectional context understanding, GPT for generative tasks, T5 framing tasks as text-to-text, and large language models like GPT-4 and PaLM. NLP tasks span text classification categorizing documents, machine translation converting between languages, question answering finding answers in text, summarization condensing content, named entity recognition identifying entities, relation extraction discovering connections, sentiment analysis detecting opinions, and dialogue systems enabling conversations. Word representations employ one-hot encoding as sparse vectors, Word2Vec learning distributed representations, GloVe capturing global statistics, FastText handling subword information, ELMo providing contextual embeddings, and BERT embeddings adapting to context. Applications include chatbots and virtual assistants, search engines improving retrieval, content recommendation personalizing suggestions, automated customer support, clinical documentation in healthcare, legal document analysis, and social media monitoring. Challenges address ambiguity resolving multiple meanings, context understanding maintaining coherence, multilingual processing across languages, and low-resource languages lacking training data.",
