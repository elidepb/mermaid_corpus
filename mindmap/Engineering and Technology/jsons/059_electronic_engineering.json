            "description": "Electronic Engineering encompasses multiple technical specializations and components. Analog circuits include operational amplifiers, transistors (BJT, FET, MOSFET), diodes, voltage regulators, and analog filters. Digital systems feature logic gates (AND, OR, NOT), flip-flops, counters, microprocessors (Intel, ARM), FPGAs, and memory (RAM, ROM, Flash). Semiconductor devices span diodes, transistors, LEDs, photodiodes, and thyristors. Embedded systems utilize microcontrollers (Arduino, PIC, STM32), real-time operating systems, and firmware development. Key tools include PCB design software (Altium, Eagle, KiCad), simulation tools (SPICE, Proteus), oscilloscopes, and logic analyzers. Applications cover consumer electronics, telecommunications, medical devices, automotive electronics, industrial automation, and wearable technology. Design considerations involve power consumption, signal integrity, EMI/EMC compliance, and miniaturization.",
