            "description": "Structural Engineering encompasses various analytical methods and design approaches. Load types include dead loads (permanent), live loads (occupancy), environmental loads (wind, seismic, snow), and special loads (impact, thermal). Structural materials span reinforced concrete, structural steel, prestressed concrete, timber, masonry, and composite materials. Structural systems feature moment frames, braced frames, shear walls, trusses, arches, domes, suspension systems, and cable structures. Analysis methods include statics, structural dynamics, finite element analysis (FEA), matrix methods, and load path analysis. Design codes encompass ACI (concrete), AISC (steel), IBC (international building), and Eurocode standards. Key software tools are SAP2000, ETABS, STAAD.Pro, RISA, and Tekla Structures. Applications cover high-rise buildings, bridges (beam, arch, suspension, cable-stayed), stadiums, towers, industrial facilities, and offshore structures. Design considerations involve strength, serviceability, ductility, redundancy, durability, and constructability.",
