            "description": "Cloud Computing encompasses multiple dimensions and components. Service models include IaaS (AWS EC2, Azure VMs), PaaS (Google App Engine, Heroku), and SaaS (Gmail, Salesforce, Office 365). Major providers are AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud. Deployment types span public, private, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments. Essential characteristics include elasticity, scalability, pay-per-use pricing, and resource pooling. Technologies involve virtualization, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and serverless computing. Benefits include cost savings, flexibility, disaster recovery, and automatic updates, while challenges encompass security concerns, vendor lock-in, compliance issues, and downtime risks.",
