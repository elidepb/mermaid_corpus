            "description": "Hydraulic Engineering encompasses multiple technical areas and applications. Fundamental principles include continuity equation, Bernoulli's equation, Manning's equation, and momentum equations. Flow types span laminar and turbulent flow, steady and unsteady flow, uniform and non-uniform flow. Open channel systems involve river engineering, canal design, storm drainage, sediment transport, and erosion control. Closed conduit systems feature pipe networks, pumping stations, pressure transients (water hammer), and distribution systems. Hydraulic structures include gravity dams, arch dams, embankment dams, spillways, gates, weirs, flumes, and locks. Analysis tools encompass HEC-RAS, SWMM, EPANET, and CFD software. Applications cover water supply systems, irrigation schemes, flood protection, hydroelectric power, wastewater conveyance, and coastal engineering. Design considerations involve flow capacity, energy dissipation, cavitation prevention, structural stability, and environmental impacts.",
