            "description": "Computer Architecture encompasses multiple layers and design philosophies. The CPU includes the ALU (arithmetic operations), Control Unit (instruction decoding), and registers (fast storage). Memory hierarchy spans registers, L1/L2/L3 cache, RAM, and secondary storage. Instruction Set Architectures include CISC (complex instructions) and RISC (reduced instructions). Processing models feature Von Neumann architecture, Harvard architecture, pipelining, and parallel processing (SIMD, MIMD). Bus systems comprise data bus, address bus, and control bus. Performance factors include clock speed, cores, cache size, and bandwidth. Modern innovations involve multi-core processors, GPUs, quantum computing, and neuromorphic chips.",
