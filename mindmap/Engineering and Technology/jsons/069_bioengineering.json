            "description": "Bioengineering encompasses diverse applications and techniques. Genetic engineering tools include CRISPR-Cas9, TALENs, zinc finger nucleases, plasmid vectors, and viral vectors for gene delivery. Bioprocessing involves upstream processing (media preparation, inoculation, cell growth), bioreactor types (stirred tank, airlift, membrane, perfusion), downstream processing (cell harvesting, purification, chromatography, filtration), and process monitoring. Tissue engineering components include natural scaffolds (collagen, alginate), synthetic scaffolds (PLA, PLGA), cell sources (stem cells, primary cells, cell lines), growth factors, and bioreactors for tissue culture. Synthetic biology uses genetic circuits, biosensors, metabolic pathway engineering, and chassis organisms (E. coli, yeast, mammalian cells). Applications span pharmaceutical production (insulin, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines), agricultural biotechnology (GM crops, pest resistance, enhanced nutrition), industrial biotechnology (biofuels, bioplastics, enzymes), and environmental applications (bioremediation, biosensors). Computational tools include genome analysis software, protein structure prediction, metabolic modeling (flux balance analysis), and systems biology platforms. Ethical considerations involve GMO safety, gene editing regulations, bioethics, and environmental impacts.",
