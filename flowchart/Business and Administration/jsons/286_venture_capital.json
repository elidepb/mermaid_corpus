            "description": "Venture Capital is the specialized financing of high-growth potential startups and early-stage companies in exchange for equity ownership, providing capital, expertise, and networks to accelerate growth. It begins with deal sourcing, identifying investment opportunities through networks, pitch events, accelerators, and proactive outreach. Due diligence conducts comprehensive evaluation of team quality, market opportunity, technology viability, competitive positioning, and financial projections. Investment decision involves partner consensus, valuation negotiation, and term sheet preparation defining ownership stakes, board seats, and protective provisions. Capital deployment structures investments across seed, Series A, B, C rounds with staged financing tied to milestone achievement. Value creation provides strategic guidance, operational support, customer introductions, talent recruitment, and follow-on funding coordination. Portfolio monitoring tracks key performance indicators, burn rate, growth metrics, and competitive threats through board participation. Exit strategy execution pursues liquidity through initial public offerings, strategic acquisitions, or secondary sales to realize returns. The goal is generating superior returns by backing exceptional entrepreneurs building scalable businesses in large addressable markets.",
