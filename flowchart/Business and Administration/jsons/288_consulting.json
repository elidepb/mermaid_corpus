            "description": "Consulting is the professional service of providing expert advice, analysis, and implementation support to organizations seeking to solve problems, improve performance, or achieve strategic objectives. It begins with client engagement, understanding business challenges, defining project scope, and establishing success criteria through discovery meetings. Diagnostic analysis investigates root causes, gathers data through interviews and document review, and identifies improvement opportunities using analytical frameworks. Solution design develops recommendations, alternative approaches, and implementation roadmaps tailored to client context and constraints. Proposal presentation communicates findings, justifies recommendations, addresses concerns, and secures buy-in from stakeholders. Implementation support guides execution through project management, change management, capability building, and interim leadership when needed. Knowledge transfer ensures sustainability by training client teams, documenting processes, and building internal capabilities. Project closure delivers final deliverables, measures outcomes against objectives, and captures lessons learned. The goal is creating measurable value by leveraging specialized expertise, objective perspective, and proven methodologies to address complex business challenges.",
