            "description": "Operations Management is the systematic design, execution, and improvement of processes that transform inputs into valuable outputs. It begins with demand forecasting to predict customer needs, followed by capacity planning to align resources. Process design establishes efficient workflows, while supply chain management coordinates material flows. Quality control ensures standards are met, inventory management balances stock levels, and scheduling optimizes resource utilization. Continuous improvement methodologies like Lean and Six Sigma eliminate waste and reduce variation. The goal is to deliver products and services efficiently, meeting customer requirements while minimizing costs and maximizing productivity.",
