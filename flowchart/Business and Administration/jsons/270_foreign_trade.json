            "description": "Foreign Trade is the systematic exchange of goods and services across international borders, governed by regulations, agreements, and economic policies. It begins with trade agreement analysis, understanding bilateral and multilateral treaties that shape market access. Export-import procedures involve documentation, customs clearance, and regulatory compliance. Tariff and duty calculation determines costs based on product classification and country of origin. Logistics coordination manages international shipping, freight forwarding, and delivery timing. Trade finance secures payment through letters of credit, documentary collections, and export financing. Quality and standards compliance ensures products meet destination country requirements. Risk management addresses currency fluctuations, political instability, and payment defaults. The goal is to facilitate efficient cross-border commerce that expands markets, optimizes costs, and manages international trade complexities.",
