            "description": "Corporate Finance is the art and science of managing a company's capital to maximize shareholder value. It focuses on three core decisions: where to invest long-term assets (investment), how to fund those investments (financing), and how to manage day-to-day cash flow (dividends and working capital). These decisions are interconnected and must balance risk against return while ensuring the company maintains adequate liquidity to operate. The ultimate goal is optimal allocation of financial resources to create sustainable value for shareholders.",
