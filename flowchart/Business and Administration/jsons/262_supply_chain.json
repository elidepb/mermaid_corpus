            "description": "Supply Chain Management is the integrated coordination of all activities involved in moving products from raw material suppliers to end customers. It begins with strategic sourcing to select suppliers and negotiate contracts, followed by procurement to acquire materials. Manufacturing transforms inputs into finished goods, while inventory management balances stock across the network. Distribution moves products through warehouses to retail points, and demand planning forecasts customer needs. Information systems enable real-time visibility and coordination across partners. The goal is to optimize the entire network for cost efficiency, speed, and customer satisfaction while managing risks and maintaining flexibility.",
