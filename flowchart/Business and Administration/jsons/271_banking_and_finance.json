            "description": "Banking and Finance is the system of institutions, markets, and instruments that facilitate money flow, credit creation, and capital allocation in the economy. It begins with deposit mobilization, where banks collect funds from savers through various account types. Credit assessment evaluates borrower creditworthiness using financial analysis and risk scoring. Lending and credit creation extends loans for consumption, business, and investment purposes. Investment services manage portfolios, execute securities transactions, and provide wealth management. Payment systems process transactions through cards, transfers, and digital platforms. Risk management identifies, measures, and mitigates financial exposures including credit, market, and operational risks. Regulatory compliance ensures adherence to capital requirements, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering rules. The goal is to efficiently intermediate between savers and borrowers while maintaining financial stability and supporting economic growth.",
