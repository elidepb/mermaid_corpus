            "description": "Knowledge Management is the systematic process of capturing, organizing, sharing, and utilizing organizational knowledge to enhance performance and innovation. It begins with knowledge identification, discovering critical knowledge assets including explicit documentation and tacit expertise held by individuals. Knowledge capture converts tacit knowledge into explicit form through documentation, interviews, and observation of experts. Knowledge organization structures information using taxonomies, metadata, and categorization systems for easy retrieval. Knowledge storage maintains repositories including databases, wikis, document management systems, and learning platforms. Knowledge sharing facilitates distribution through communities of practice, mentoring, collaboration tools, and knowledge transfer sessions. Knowledge application puts insights into practice through decision support, problem-solving, and innovation processes. Knowledge evaluation assesses relevance, accuracy, and usage to identify gaps and opportunities. The goal is to leverage collective intelligence, prevent knowledge loss, accelerate learning, and drive continuous improvement.",
