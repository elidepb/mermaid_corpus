            "description": "Taxation is the systematic process of levying and collecting compulsory payments from individuals and entities to fund government operations and public services. It begins with tax jurisdiction determination, establishing where taxpayers owe obligations based on residence, citizenship, or income source. Income calculation measures taxable income by aggregating revenues and applying allowable deductions and exemptions. Tax liability computation applies applicable rates to taxable income, considering progressive brackets, flat rates, or hybrid systems. Tax credits and incentives reduce liability through investment incentives, social benefits, and economic development programs. Compliance and filing submit returns, documentation, and payments within statutory deadlines. Tax planning optimizes strategies to minimize liability through legal structuring, timing, and election choices. Enforcement and collection ensure compliance through audits, penalties, and collection mechanisms. The goal is equitable revenue generation while promoting economic efficiency and social objectives.",
