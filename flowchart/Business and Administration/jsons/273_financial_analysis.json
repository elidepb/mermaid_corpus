            "description": "Financial Analysis is the systematic evaluation of financial data to assess business performance, health, and investment potential. It begins with data collection, gathering financial statements including balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. Horizontal analysis compares financial data across multiple periods to identify trends and growth patterns. Vertical analysis examines financial statement components as percentages of totals to understand composition. Ratio analysis calculates liquidity, profitability, efficiency, and leverage metrics to evaluate performance dimensions. Cash flow analysis assesses operating, investing, and financing activities to understand liquidity and sustainability. Valuation determines company worth using discounted cash flow, comparable company analysis, and precedent transactions. Forecasting projects future performance based on historical trends and assumptions. The goal is to provide insights for investment decisions, credit assessments, and strategic planning.",
