            "description": "Project Management is the disciplined application of knowledge, skills, and techniques to execute projects successfully within constraints of time, cost, and scope. It begins with project initiation, defining objectives, stakeholders, and feasibility. Planning develops detailed schedules, budgets, resource allocation, and risk strategies. Execution mobilizes teams to perform project tasks and deliverables. Monitoring and controlling track progress against baselines, manage changes, and resolve issues. Quality assurance ensures deliverables meet requirements. Stakeholder communication maintains alignment and expectations. Project closure formally completes deliverables, documents lessons learned, and releases resources. The goal is to deliver defined outcomes on time, within budget, meeting quality standards while managing risks and stakeholder expectations.",
