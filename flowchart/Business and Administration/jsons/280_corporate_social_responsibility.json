            "description": "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is the strategic integration of social, environmental, and ethical considerations into business operations and stakeholder relationships beyond legal compliance. It begins with stakeholder mapping, identifying all parties affected by business operations including employees, communities, suppliers, customers, and environment. Materiality assessment prioritizes issues based on significance to stakeholders and business impact. CSR strategy development aligns initiatives with core business values, capabilities, and strategic objectives. Program implementation executes initiatives across environmental sustainability, social equity, ethical governance, and community investment. Impact measurement quantifies outcomes using metrics like carbon footprint reduction, employee satisfaction, and community benefits. Transparent reporting communicates performance through sustainability reports, ESG disclosures, and stakeholder engagement. Continuous improvement refines approaches based on feedback and evolving expectations. The goal is to create shared value by balancing profit with purpose, building reputation, and contributing to sustainable development.",
