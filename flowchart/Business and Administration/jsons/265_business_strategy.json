It begins with environmental analysis, examining external opportunities and threats through industry analysis and market trends. Internal assessment evaluates organizational strengths and weaknesses, resources, and capabilities. Strategic formulation defines vision, mission, and strategic objectives aligned with competitive positioning. Strategy selection chooses among alternatives like cost leadership, differentiation, or focus strategies. Implementation executes through resource allocation, organizational alignment, and change management. Performance monitoring tracks progress using balanced scorecards and KPIs. Strategic review adapts plans based on results and changing conditions. The goal is sustainable competitive advantage that creates superior value for stakeholders.",
