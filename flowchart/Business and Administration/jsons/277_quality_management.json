            "description": "Quality Management is the systematic approach to ensuring products and services consistently meet or exceed customer expectations through continuous improvement. It begins with quality planning, establishing standards, specifications, and acceptance criteria aligned with customer requirements. Process design develops procedures and workflows that build quality into operations rather than inspecting it afterward. Quality control implements inspection, testing, and monitoring to detect defects and variations. Statistical process control uses data analysis to identify trends, patterns, and out-of-control conditions. Corrective action addresses root causes of defects through problem-solving methodologies like 5 Whys and fishbone diagrams. Preventive action anticipates potential issues and implements safeguards before problems occur. Continuous improvement employs methodologies like Kaizen, Six Sigma, and Lean to systematically enhance performance. The goal is to achieve excellence through defect prevention, waste elimination, and customer satisfaction.",
