            "description": "Entrepreneurship is the process of identifying opportunities, mobilizing resources, and creating value through innovative ventures. It begins with opportunity recognition, where entrepreneurs identify market gaps or unmet needs. Idea validation tests assumptions through market research and customer feedback. Business planning develops the roadmap including business model, financial projections, and go-to-market strategy. Resource acquisition secures funding, talent, and infrastructure. Launch execution brings the venture to market. Growth scaling expands operations and market reach. Continuous iteration adapts based on feedback and market dynamics. The goal is to build sustainable ventures that solve problems, create jobs, and generate economic value while navigating uncertainty and risk.",
