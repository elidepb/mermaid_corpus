            "description": "Franchising is the business expansion method where franchisors license their brand, operating systems, and business model to independent franchisees who pay fees and royalties in exchange for proven business frameworks and ongoing support. It begins with franchise system development, creating standardized operations manuals, training programs, brand guidelines, and support infrastructure. Legal documentation establishes franchise disclosure documents and franchise agreements defining rights, obligations, fees, territories, and renewal terms under regulatory compliance. Franchisee recruitment identifies qualified candidates through marketing, screening for financial capacity, business acumen, and cultural fit. Training and onboarding transfer knowledge through classroom instruction, hands-on practice, and field support during launch. Site selection and setup assistance helps franchisees choose locations, design facilities, and establish operations meeting brand standards. Ongoing support provides marketing programs, operational guidance, technology systems, and quality assurance. Performance monitoring tracks sales, customer satisfaction, and compliance through field visits and reporting systems. The goal is rapid geographic expansion with lower capital requirements while maintaining brand consistency and quality standards through motivated local owner-operators.",
