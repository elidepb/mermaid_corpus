It begins with understanding customer needs through market research, then segmenting markets to identify target audiences. Companies position their offerings to differentiate from competitors, develop the marketing mix (product, price, place, promotion), implement campaigns, and measure results to optimize performance. The goal is to satisfy customer needs profitably while building long-term brand loyalty and market share.",
