            "description": "A Computer Network is an interconnected system of devices that share resources and communicate through transmission media. Its primary purpose is to enable data exchange and resource sharing across distributed locations. Core components include: network topology (physical/logical arrangement like star, mesh, bus), protocols (rules governing communication such as TCP/IP, HTTP), hardware (routers, switches, cables), and transmission media (wired or wireless). Networks are classified by scale (LAN, MAN, WAN) and facilitate services like file sharing, email, web access, and remote collaboration, ultimately achieving connectivity and efficiency.",
