            "description": "Computer Simulation is the computational modeling and emulation of real-world systems, processes, or phenomena using mathematical representations and algorithms to predict behavior, test hypotheses, and support decision-making without physical experimentation. It begins with system analysis, studying the real-world system to understand components, interactions, variables, and dynamics requiring representation. Model formulation translates system understanding into mathematical equations, state variables, relationships, and constraints capturing essential behaviors. Parameter estimation determines model coefficients through calibration using historical data, expert knowledge, or literature values ensuring accuracy. Algorithm selection chooses appropriate numerical methods including discrete-event simulation, agent-based modeling, system dynamics, or Monte Carlo techniques matching problem characteristics. Implementation codes the model using simulation software or programming languages incorporating logic, equations, and stochastic elements. Verification ensures the model is implemented correctly through debugging, unit testing, and code review eliminating programming errors. Validation confirms the model accurately represents reality by comparing simulation outputs with observed data and expert judgment. Experimentation runs multiple scenarios varying parameters, initial conditions, or policies exploring system behavior and sensitivities. Analysis interprets results identifying patterns, trends, optimal configurations, and actionable insights supporting decisions. The goal is understanding complex systems through virtual experimentation enabling risk-free testing, optimization, training, prediction, and design exploration across engineering, healthcare, economics, climate science, and defense applications.",
