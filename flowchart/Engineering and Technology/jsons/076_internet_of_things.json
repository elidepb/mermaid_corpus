            "description": "Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of interconnected physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity enabling data collection, exchange, and autonomous action without human intervention. It begins with device design, creating hardware with sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and communication modules tailored to specific use cases. Connectivity implementation establishes network protocols including WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular, LoRaWAN, or Zigbee enabling device communication. Data collection captures environmental parameters, operational metrics, or user interactions through various sensor types. Data transmission sends collected information to cloud platforms, edge gateways, or local servers using efficient protocols and compression. Data processing analyzes incoming streams through edge computing for real-time decisions or cloud analytics for complex computations. Application integration connects IoT data with business systems, mobile apps, dashboards, and automation platforms. Security implementation protects devices, communications, and data through encryption, authentication, firmware updates, and intrusion detection. Device management handles provisioning, configuration, monitoring, diagnostics, and over-the-air updates at scale. The goal is creating intelligent, connected ecosystems that enhance efficiency, enable predictive maintenance, optimize resource usage, and deliver personalized experiences through pervasive sensing and actuation.",
