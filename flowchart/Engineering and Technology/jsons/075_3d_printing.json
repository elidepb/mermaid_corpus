            "description": "3D Printing, also known as Additive Manufacturing, is the process of creating three-dimensional objects by depositing material layer-by-layer based on digital models. Its primary objective is to enable rapid prototyping, customized manufacturing, and complex geometry production with reduced waste and tooling costs. Core domains include: printing technologies (FDM/FFF, SLA/DLP, SLS, binder jetting, material extrusion), materials (thermoplastics, photopolymers, metals, ceramics, bioinks), design for additive manufacturing (topology optimization, lattice structures, support generation), post-processing (surface finishing, heat treatment, infiltration, painting), and quality control (dimensional accuracy, material properties, defect detection). The manufacturing process involves CAD design, file preparation (STL conversion, slicing), printing setup, layer-by-layer fabrication, post-processing, and quality inspection. These elements converge through materials science, mechanical engineering, and computer-aided design to produce prototypes, custom parts, medical implants, aerospace components, and consumer products with unprecedented design freedom and production flexibility.",
