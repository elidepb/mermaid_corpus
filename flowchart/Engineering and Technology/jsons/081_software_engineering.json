            "description": "Software Engineering is the systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software applying engineering principles to create reliable, efficient, and maintainable systems at scale. It begins with requirements engineering, eliciting, analyzing, documenting, and validating stakeholder needs through interviews, workshops, and prototyping. Software architecture design establishes high-level system structure, component interactions, technology choices, and architectural patterns ensuring scalability and maintainability. Detailed design specifies algorithms, data structures, interfaces, and component-level implementations with design patterns and principles. Implementation translates designs into code following coding standards, best practices, and software craftsmanship principles using appropriate languages and frameworks. Quality assurance encompasses unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing ensuring correctness and reliability. Configuration management tracks versions, manages changes, controls releases, and maintains code repositories enabling team collaboration. Project management coordinates schedules, resources, risks, and stakeholder communication throughout development lifecycle. Deployment and operations releases software to production environments with continuous integration/deployment pipelines and operational monitoring. Maintenance and evolution addresses defects, implements enhancements, refactors technical debt, and adapts to changing requirements. The goal is delivering high-quality software systematically that meets user needs, remains maintainable over time, and can evolve with technological and business changes.",
