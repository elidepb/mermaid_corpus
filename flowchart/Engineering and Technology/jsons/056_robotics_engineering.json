            "description": "Robotics Engineering is the interdisciplinary field that designs, constructs, and operates robots to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. Its primary goal is to create intelligent machines that enhance human capabilities and automate complex processes. Core disciplines include: mechanical design (structural components, actuators, mobility systems), electronics & control systems (sensors, microcontrollers, power management), programming & AI (algorithms, machine learning, path planning), and human-robot interaction (interfaces, safety protocols). These elements integrate through systems engineering principles, utilizing feedback loops and real-time processing to achieve precise, adaptive, and efficient robotic operations across industrial, medical, service, and exploration applications.",
