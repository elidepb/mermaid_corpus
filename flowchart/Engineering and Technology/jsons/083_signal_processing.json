            "description": "Signal Processing is the mathematical analysis, manipulation, and transformation of signals (time-varying or spatial data) to extract information, remove noise, compress data, or enhance features for interpretation and decision-making. It begins with signal acquisition, capturing analog signals through sensors, transducers, or measurement devices converting physical phenomena to electrical signals. Analog-to-digital conversion samples continuous signals at appropriate rates following Nyquist theorem and quantizes amplitudes creating digital representations. Preprocessing removes artifacts, filters noise, normalizes amplitudes, and segments signals preparing data for analysis. Time-domain analysis examines signal characteristics like amplitude, frequency, phase, and temporal patterns using statistical measures. Frequency-domain analysis applies Fourier transforms decomposing signals into frequency components revealing spectral characteristics and periodic patterns. Filtering implements low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, or adaptive filters removing unwanted frequencies while preserving signal features. Feature extraction identifies discriminative characteristics, patterns, or parameters relevant for classification or recognition tasks. Signal reconstruction and synthesis generates output signals for applications like audio playback, image display, or control systems. The goal is extracting meaningful information from noisy, complex signals enabling applications across telecommunications, audio/video processing, biomedical monitoring, radar systems, and control engineering through mathematical transformations and algorithmic processing.",
