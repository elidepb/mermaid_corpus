            "description": "Materials Engineering is the discipline that studies the structure, properties, processing, and performance of materials to develop new materials and optimize existing ones for specific applications. Its primary objective is to design and select materials that meet performance requirements while considering cost, sustainability, and manufacturability. Core domains include: materials science fundamentals (atomic structure, bonding, crystallography, phase diagrams), materials processing (casting, forming, heat treatment, synthesis methods), materials characterization (microscopy, spectroscopy, mechanical testing), materials classes (metals, ceramics, polymers, composites), and materials selection (property optimization, failure analysis, life cycle assessment). The engineering approach involves understanding structure-property relationships, processing optimization, performance testing, and application-specific design. These elements integrate through thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanics to create advanced materials for aerospace, automotive, electronics, energy, biomedical, and construction industries.",
