            "description": "Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, enabling on-demand access to shared resources without direct management. Its primary goal is to provide scalable, flexible, and cost-effective IT solutions. Core service models include: IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service - virtualized computing resources), PaaS (Platform as a Service - development and deployment platforms), and SaaS (Software as a Service - ready-to-use applications). Deployment models vary between public, private, hybrid, and community clouds. Key characteristics include on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service, ultimately delivering agility, reduced costs, and global accessibility.",
