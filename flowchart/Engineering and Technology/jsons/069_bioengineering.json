            "description": "Bioengineering is the broad interdisciplinary field that applies engineering principles to biological systems, integrating biology, medicine, and engineering to solve problems in healthcare, agriculture, and biotechnology. Its primary objective is to design and develop biological systems, devices, and processes that improve human health, enhance agricultural productivity, and advance biotechnological applications. Core domains include: genetic engineering (DNA manipulation, gene editing, synthetic biology), bioprocess engineering (fermentation, bioreactor design, downstream processing), tissue engineering (scaffold design, cell culture, organ regeneration), biomolecular engineering (protein engineering, enzyme optimization, drug design), and systems biology (metabolic modeling, biological networks, computational analysis). The engineering approach involves biological system design, molecular techniques, computational modeling, scale-up optimization, and validation testing. These elements converge through molecular biology, biochemistry, and thermodynamics to create genetically modified organisms, biopharmaceuticals, engineered tissues, biofuels, and sustainable bioprocesses for medicine, agriculture, and industry.",
