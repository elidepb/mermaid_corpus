            "description": "Biomedical Engineering is the interdisciplinary field that applies engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology for healthcare purposes. Its primary objective is to develop innovative technologies, devices, and systems that diagnose, monitor, and treat medical conditions while improving patient outcomes. Core domains include: medical devices (diagnostic equipment, therapeutic devices, surgical instruments), biomaterials (implants, tissue scaffolds, biocompatible materials), medical imaging (MRI, CT, ultrasound, X-ray systems), biomechanics (prosthetics, orthotics, rehabilitation devices), and bioinformatics & computational biology (data analysis, modeling, drug discovery). The development process involves clinical needs assessment, design and prototyping, biological testing, regulatory approval (FDA), and clinical implementation. These elements converge through biology, physiology, materials science, and electronics to create diagnostic tools, therapeutic devices, artificial organs, and rehabilitation technologies that enhance healthcare delivery and patient quality of life.",
