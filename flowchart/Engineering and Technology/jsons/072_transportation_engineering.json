            "description": "Transportation Engineering is the specialized branch of civil engineering that plans, designs, operates, and maintains transportation systems to move people and goods safely and efficiently. Its primary objective is to develop integrated, sustainable transportation infrastructure that optimizes mobility, reduces congestion, enhances safety, and minimizes environmental impact. Core domains include: highway engineering (geometric design, pavement design, traffic flow analysis, intersection design), traffic engineering (signal timing, traffic management, capacity analysis, intelligent transportation systems), public transit systems (rail transit, bus rapid transit, station design, scheduling), transportation planning (demand forecasting, network optimization, land use integration), and transportation safety (accident analysis, safety audits, countermeasure design). The engineering process involves data collection and analysis, demand modeling, design and simulation, implementation, and performance evaluation. These elements integrate through traffic flow theory, optimization algorithms, and human factors to create highways, urban streets, transit systems, airports, and multimodal transportation networks that support economic development and quality of life.",
