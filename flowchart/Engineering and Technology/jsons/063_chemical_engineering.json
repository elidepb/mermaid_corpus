            "description": "Chemical Engineering is the discipline that applies principles of chemistry, physics, mathematics, and economics to efficiently transform raw materials into valuable products through chemical and physical processes. Its primary objective is to design, optimize, and operate industrial processes for large-scale production while ensuring safety, sustainability, and profitability. Core domains include: process design (unit operations, flowsheet development, process simulation), reaction engineering (reactor design, kinetics, catalysis), separation processes (distillation, extraction, filtration, crystallization), thermodynamics & transport phenomena (heat transfer, mass transfer, fluid flow), and process control (automation, instrumentation, optimization). The engineering approach involves laboratory research, pilot-scale testing, process scale-up, plant design, and operation management. These elements converge through material and energy balances, kinetics, and economics to produce chemicals, fuels, pharmaceuticals, materials, and consumer products safely and economically.",
