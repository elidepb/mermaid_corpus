            "description": "Petroleum Engineering is the specialized discipline focused on exploring, extracting, and producing hydrocarbon resources including oil and natural gas from subsurface reservoirs through drilling, completion, and production optimization techniques. It begins with reservoir characterization, analyzing geological data, seismic surveys, and well logs to understand rock properties, fluid content, and reservoir geometry. Drilling engineering designs wellbore trajectories, selects drilling fluids and equipment, and manages operations to safely reach target formations. Well completion designs production systems including casing, tubing, perforations, and artificial lift determining how fluids flow from reservoir to surface. Reservoir simulation models fluid flow through porous rock using numerical methods predicting production rates and recovery factors. Production optimization maximizes hydrocarbon recovery through pressure maintenance, enhanced oil recovery techniques, and production facilities design. Well intervention and workover perform maintenance, stimulation, and remedial operations maintaining or enhancing productivity. Facilities engineering designs surface equipment including separators, pumps, compressors, and pipelines processing and transporting hydrocarbons. Environmental and safety management addresses drilling waste, emissions control, blowout prevention, and regulatory compliance. The goal is economically extracting hydrocarbon resources while minimizing environmental impact through advanced technologies including horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and enhanced recovery methods maximizing ultimate recovery from subsurface reservoirs.",
