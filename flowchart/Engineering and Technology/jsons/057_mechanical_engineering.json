            "description": "Mechanical Engineering is the discipline that applies principles of physics, materials science, and mathematics to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems. Its primary objective is to solve practical problems through innovative engineering solutions. Core domains include: thermodynamics & heat transfer (energy conversion, HVAC systems, engines), mechanics & dynamics (statics, kinematics, structural analysis), materials science (material selection, strength, properties), and manufacturing processes (machining, casting, CAD/CAM). Design methodology involves conceptualization, analysis (FEA, CFD), prototyping, and testing. These elements converge through engineering principles to create efficient, reliable, and sustainable mechanical systems for transportation, energy, manufacturing, and consumer products.",
